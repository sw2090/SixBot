Kyujanggak Institute for Korean StudiesThe Filial Daughter of Kwaksan: \nFinger Severing, Confucian Virtues, and Envoy Poetry in Early Choso \u02d8n\nWang Sixiang\nAmong the three cardinal human relations in Confucian morality, filiality stands out as \nthe only one with the potential of being universally applicable. While chastity fell upon women and loyalty was meaningful for elite men, all human beings were children of \nsome parents. This paper will investigate filiality in early Choso \u02d8n Korea through one \nrelatively obscure figure, Kim Sawo \u02d8l. Severing her finger and feeding it to her ailing mother, Kim\u2019s remarkable act of filial devotion earned the recognition of the Choso \u02d8n court. Though not the only finger severer in Choso \u02d8n, a fact of geography propelled her \nto renown among the generations of Ming envoys who passed by her hometown, many \nof whom left poems in her honor. Both the Ming envoys and the Choso \u02d8n court, however, had to grapple with the potentially heterodox implications of her cannibalistic filial act. Not only did finger severing have resonances with Buddhist notions, local \nreligious traditions, and fringe medical lore, but it directly contradicted classical \nConfucian injunctions against \u201cself-harm.\u201d The resolution of this problem, in both the envoy poetry and the Choso \u02d8n social context, involved reinterpretations and rewritings that converted a problematic category of behavior into symbols of a Confucian civilizing \nproject by emphasizing the affective power of sincere filial emotion. This mechanism of \nconversion and accommodation may partly explain how local differences and alternative cosmologies persisted in the context of Confucian hegemony in Choso \u02d8n Korea. \nKeywords:  Filiality, envoy poetry, cannibalism, Samgang haengsil to, Confucianism, \nearly Choso \u02d8n\n176    Wang Sixiang\nIntroduction\nIn 1422, King Sejong (r. 1418-1450) ordered a memorial gate (cho \u02d8ngnyo \u02d8  \u65cc\u95ad) \nbe erected in honor of a woman named Kim Sawo \u02d8l \u91d1\u56db\u6708  from the Korean \nprovincial town of Kwaksan \u90ed\u5c71. Kim had been brought to the court\u2019s attention \nbecause she had cured her mother of an illness through a remarkable feat of \nfilial devotion. Learning that the pulverized bone of a living person could cure madness, she severed her own finger and fed it to her mother as medicine.\n1 The \nrulers of Choso \u02d8n Korea (1392-1910) made it a point to recognize individuals who displayed such virtues as part of a concerted effort to propagate Confucian social norms. Besides granting rewards and emoluments associated with official recognition, these rulers also included exemplary individuals in compilations of didactic texts, the Illustrated Guide ( Haengsil to \n\u884c\u5be6\u5716 ) series.2 These compil-\nations honored individuals whose deeds exemplified the three cardinal human relationships (K. samgang, Ch. sangang \n\u4e09\u7db1) by demonstrating the correspond-\ning virtues of filiality (K. hyo, Ch. xiao \u5b5d), loyalty (K. ch\u2019ung, Ch. zhong \u5fe0), \nand chastity (K. y o\u02d8 l , Ch. lie \u70c8; Ch. jie \u7bc0) in Confucian morality.3\nUnlike loyalty to the state, generally the purview of elite men, and chastity, \nwhich only applied to women, filiality alone among these three had the potential to be universally relevant.

The terms that fall underneath the category of \u201cchastity\u201d occupy different places in Choso\u02d8 n and \nMing commemorative practice. The Ming distinguished between jie and lie as distinct categories \nand honored both with memorial gates. The first category applied to women who refused \nremarriage, while the latter often involved steadfast commitment to chastity demonstrated \nthrough death or self-mutilation. The early Chos o\u02d8n court, on the other hand, only commemorated \n\u201cyo \u02d8llyo \u02d8 :\u201d women who \u201chave revealed really extraordinary chastity\u201d (Lee 2009, 138-139); \nJungwon Kim also distinguishes between Chinese and Korean usage of these terms (Kim 2007, \n17-18; 41).\n4. The male gendering of loyalty can be seen in the circuitous manner in which the courtesan \nNon\u2019gae \u8ad6\u4ecb came to be commemorated as an exemplar of \u201cloyalty.\u201d During the Imjin War, she \n The Filial Daughter of Kwaksan     177    \nsurprisingly, the celebration of filial virtue played a pivotal role in the early \nChoso \u02d8n state\u2019s project of Confucianization.

While the Choso \u02d8n state could appeal to the Confucian canon to justify its encouragement of Confucian family rituals, her \nact of finger severing, even for an ailing parent, fell outside the purview of \nclassical prescription.

Imperial envoys from Ming China (1368-1644) traveling \nbetween Beijing and Seoul regularly journeyed through her hometown of \nKwaksan, a stop along the way through P\u2019yo \u02d8ngan province. On his way back to \nBeijing, the 1449 envoy Ni Qian \u502a\u8b19 (1415-1479) noticed, alongside the road, \nkilled an enemy general by embracing him and jumping into a river.

The TGSS does include examples of non-elites of both genders in its section for loyal subjects. These cases all date from the Imjin War and \ninvolve male and female slaves dying for their masters. In such cases, the master-slave relationship \nserves as an extension of the ruler-subject relationship. Notably, none of these cases involve loyalty directly to the state; neither are there elite women represented in this category. For examples of female slaves, see TGSS, ch\u2019ungsin to 1:81-85.

Ni wrote the following of this encounter:\nSince it is my duty to discover good deeds, how can I not have a single word to \neulogize this? Now, if those gentlemen who have accompanied me could write a poem in response, it would do justice to the virtue of the East [i.e. Korea.] \nThe poem Ni composed, and his exhortation to follow his example, helped \ninaugurate a tradition in Choso \u02d8n-Ming diplomacy. Though not the first Ming \nliteratus to exchange poems with Koreans, Ni Qian\u2019s eagerness for recognition \noutstripped that of his predecessors. He was the first to publish his envoy poetry \nin Ming China. His anthology, the Liaohai Compilation ( Liaohai bian \u907c\u6d77\u7de8 ), \npublished in 1464, helped bring Kim Sawo \u02d8l to the attention of future Ming envoys, who in turn also wrote poems on Sawo \u02d8l as they passed her memorial \ngate. The Choso \u02d8n court\u2019s own poetry anthologies, The Collection of Brilliant \nFlowers  (Hwanghwajip  \n\u7687\u83ef\u96c6 ), a series that collected the poems of Ming \nenvoys, catalyzed these interactions by documenting the poetic accomplishments \nof their predecessors.7 \nKwaksan thus became a place where subsequent Ming envoys rendered \nhomage to the filial Sawo \u02d8l, one of the most persistent subjects of their envoy \npoetry. These anthologies fostered a sense of tradition, embedded in space and \nthrough time, providing a textual repertoire of poetic knowledge.

The Classic of Filial Piety (Xiaojing \n\u5b5d\u7d93) states, for example, \u201cYour physical person with its hair and skin are \nreceived from your parents. Vigilance in not allowing anything to do injury to \nyour person is where [filiality] begins.\u201d14 Though filial cannibalism can also be \nread as a logical extension of the notion of self-sacrifice, Ming period editions of the popular Twenty-four Filial Acts (Ch. Ershisi xiao \n\u4e8c\u5341\u56db\u5b5d ), which praised \nchildren who made personal sacrifices for their parents, did not contain any \n13. In this paper I use \u201cfilial cannibalism\u201d tentatively to describe instances of children offering \ntheir own flesh to their parents as acts of filial devotion. The term is not without its problems, since it risks conflating the \u201ccannibal\u201d i.e. the parent, with the child, the filial agent. Martha Sibau, who is critical of the term \u201ccannibalism,\u201d prefers the term \u201cfilial slicing\u201d partly because the emphasis in these filial narratives is not on the act of eating per se, but on the action of the cutting \n(2011, 105n127). \u201cFilial slicing\u201d then, is a derivation of the term used for these instances in \nChinese sources: gegu (K. halgo \n\u5272\u80a1) literally \u201cslicing the thigh (or limb),\u201d but can also refer to \nany kind of flesh cutting (Qiu 1995, 51; Yu 2008, 96). While Tina Lu generally prefers the term gegu, she notes that \u201cfiliality and cannibalism are inextricably linked\u201d in late imperial China (Lu 2008, 147-148). In the Korean context, \u201cthigh slicing\u201d often appears alongside tanji (\u201cfinger \nsevering\u201d \n\u65b7\u6307) to describe what Cho Namuk has termed yuksin hyohaeng \u8089\u8eab\u5b5d\u884c , \u201cfilial acts of \nthe body\u201d (Cho 2009, 124-145). The term \u201cfinger severing\u201d I will reserve specifically for such instances where fingers are involved, in order to distinguish the specificity of the practice in the Korean context.\n14.

Qiu Zhonglin has \nargued that while filial cannibalism began as popular practice in the Tang-Song \nperiods, it reached general social acceptance among gentry circles by the Ming. \nEven amid reluctant imperial recognition by the Qing (1644-1911), Chinese \nliterati discourse did not settle into an easy consensus regarding the propriety of \nfilial cannibalism, though there appeared to be a growing set of voices pushing for the acceptance of filial cannibalism as a legitimate practice (Qiu 1995, \n72-90). Though there was official recognition of such acts during the Ming, \nthey were also controversial. The first emperor, Ming Taizu (r. 1368-1398) had actually explicitly banned both this and similar practices and their commemor-\nation. The prohibition against \u201cthigh slicing\u201d and \u201cice sitting\u201d as acts \u201charmful \nto the body\u201d (\n\u5272\u80a1\u81e5 \u51b0 \u50b7\u8eab\u6709\u7981 ) arose from Ming Taizu\u2019s reaction to a particular \nincident involving a man who offered his own flesh to his parent, and failing \nthat, prayed to a god and killed his three year old child as an offering. When a \nlocal official proposed to honor him as a paragon of filial devotion, Ming Taizu was \u201cangered that [he] has destroyed morals and extinguished principle\u201d (\n\u6012\u5176 \n\u7d55\u502b\u6ec5\u7406 ), and instead had him flogged and exiled. The Ming emperor\u2019s \ninjunction against such behavior was rooted in the perceived incompatibility \nbetween orthodox notions of filiality and self-mutilation. The circumstances of \nthe case also suggests multivalent religious traditions and local practices may have informed behavior, even as these actions all become conflated into the \nlarger categories of \u201cmutilation\u201d (Ch. shangshen  \n\u50b7\u8eab) and \u201cviolation\u201d (Ch. \n15. Twenty-four Filial Acts, better understood as a \u201cgenre of popular works,\u201d rather than a single \ntext, has existed in various forms. The individual stories date from medieval China, and figure \nprominently in Song, Jin, and Yuan tombs (Knapp 2005, 4-5, 110). The work usually consists of twenty-four illustrations depicting acts of filial devotion, each accompanied by a brief text description. For the purposes of this paper I will refer to a Ming period manuscript edition with \nan attributed date of 1546, the Selected Poems of the Twenty-four Filial Acts (Ershisi xiao shi \nxuan \n\u4e8c\u5341\u56db\u5b5d\u8a69\u9078 ) that has been preserved in the Ryu \u00afkoku University Library and a Qing edition \nreproduced in Chang\u2019s comparative study of didactic texts for filiality in China and Korea (Chang \n2004, 267-292).

For an \noverview of the various iterations of works by this title, and a brief discussion of the omission of \u201cfilial cannibalism\u201d in Ming editions, see Osawa 2002, esp. pp. 16-17. \n The Filial Daughter of Kwaksan     183    \nweidao \u9055\u9053).16 Multiple voices regarding these issues seem to emerge especially \nin literature, where often fantastical allegories demonstrate diverse attitudes \ntowards the practice (Lu 2008, 135-174; Sibau 2011, 34-119).\nUnderstanding Sawo \u02d8l\u2019s finger severing (K. tanji \u65b7\u6307) solely as one form of \nfilial cannibalism, however, risks ignoring the specificity of finger severing as a \nsignificant social phenomenon in Choso \u02d8n Korea.

It should also be noted that there are numerous other examples of finger cutting, not as instances of filial devotion, but as cases of widows showing their resolve to refuse remarriage (Qiu 1995, 52).\n18. Qiu Zhonglin\u2019s numbers are taken from cases mentioned in the sections of the Gujin tushu \njicheng  dealing with exemplars of \u201cLearning and Deeds\u201d ( \u5b78\u884c\u5178) and exemplary \u201cWives and \nDaughters\u201d (\u95a8\u5a9b\u5178), and thus include examples from early times through the Ming. Unlike the \nIllustrated Guides in Choso\u02d8 n, these examples are collected from a variety of sources and, as one \nsection in a massive compilation, were not intended for broad dissemination. Some figures appear \nin local gazetteers or literati poetry, while only some may have received state recognition. \nAlthough these two sources document \u201cfilial cannibalism\u201d in rather different ways and for distinct purposes, making definitive comparisons difficult, the contrast in the frequency and relative occurrence of \u201cfinger severing\u201d between the two compilations is stark. According to my tabulation of cases of finger severing in the TGSS, the rates for finger severing in proportion to other acts of filial devotion over time are as follows: 5 out 64 (7.8%) cases from pre-Choso\u02d8 n, \n42/184 (22.8%/.36 commemorations per year) from before the reign of Yo\u02d8 nsan\u2019gun (1392-1494), \n73/217 (33.6%/.72) commemorations per year between the reigns of Yo\u02d8 nsan-So\u02d8 njo (1494-1608), \nand 83/240 (34.5%/10.375) in the first decade of Kwanghaegun\u2019s reign alone (1608-1617). These figures do not include cases where individuals were recognized for a different kind of filial act, but were also known to have severed their fingers. Cho\u02d8 ng argues that the publication of this particular \nsource should be understood within its context and should not simply be taken as a verbatim \n184    Wang Sixiang\nof the total.19\nThe recognition of finger severing as a specific, localized phenomenon \nreveals a distinct historical trajectory in the Confucian civilizing project of the \nearly Choso \u02d8n state. To be sure, the early Choso \u02d8n state shared reservations about \nfinger severing similar to the early Ming court\u2019s anxiety regarding filial \ncannibalism.

The continued rewarding of such actions that were \n\u201cbeyond the norm\u201d (K. kwasang  \u904e\u5e38) lead to concerns that they would \novershadow more habitual, prosaic forms of devotion that were harder to observe, but were\u2014because they reflected sincere sentiments through their \nconsistency\u2014more fundamental to filiality.\n25 In practice, however, dramatic \npractices in East Asia. When it comes to filiality, Buddhist and Confucian ideas were not \nnecessarily seen as antithetical, but rather complementary, especially for those in the late Ming who sought a synthesis of the \u201cThree Teachings,\u201d of Buddhism, Confucianism, and Daoism (L\u00fc 2011, 150-158); for a discussion of the textual history of this particular series of su \u00aftras, see Guang 2008.\n23. The first documented example of a filial child who fed his flesh to a parent was a Buddhist \nmonk from the Silla. Most examples in the TGSS do not indicate how a filial child came to be \ninspired to sever his finger. In two early examples, the child learns of the method through a dream, one visited by his sick father and the other a Buddhist monk. See TGSS v. 1.2; v. 2.19, 82. A few other cases only mention that they \u201cheard\u201d from others that \u201cthe bone of a living person\u201d could heal their parent. See TGSS v. 2.16; v. 3.17, 23. A doctor appears in another, later example: TGSS v. 6.28. For Cho\u02d8 ng Ilyo\u02d8 ng, the practice of filial cannibalism in the Korean context is explained as a \nturn to \u201csuperstitious\u201d healing methods by individuals of lower status who may not have had \naccess to medical treatment, a situation he believes to be parallel to how such acts emerged in \nChina (Ch o\u02d8ng 2010, 87).

From now one, have both the central and provincial officials recommend examples of these so that we can promote virtuous \n186    Wang Sixiang\ngestures, such as finger severing, had the convenience of visibility and offered \ntangible examples for emulation.\nThe questionable appropriateness of finger severing may also be related to \nthe medical dimension of the practice. The earliest account of Kim Sawo \u02d8l\u2019s \nactions in the Choso \u02d8n wangjo sillok describes Kim searching for a way to cure \nher mother\u2019s madness. She was told to \u201ccrush the bones of a living person\u201d and that \u201cconsuming them will have immediate results.\u201d\n26 Filial cannibalism was \nthus likely rooted in some belief that human flesh itself had intrinsic curative \nproperties. A startling case from 1546 involving a missing child illustrates this \npoint. The three-year-old\u2019s corpse was discovered after two weeks, with its right \nhand missing two fingers. According to the investigation, a man afflicted with a \n\u201csevere illness\u201d had paid the murderer to kidnap the child and sever his fingers for medicine.\n27 In apologies for filial cannibalism, the curative power of the \nchild\u2019s flesh was attributed to the \u201caffective power of emotion\u201d eliciting a \nsympathetic response from nature, not medical properties inherent in human \nflesh. In this case, however, the belief in the therapeutic effect of consuming \nhuman flesh could not have rested on the power of filial emotion alone, but on \nthe belief in the inherent curative properties of severed fingers.\nIt is difficult to ascertain a distinct relationship between specific medical \nailments and practices of finger cutting, especially when early Choso \u02d8n records of filial cannibalism are generally vague about the symptoms of the parent\u2019s disease.

Taken together this evidence\u2014the specificity of finger severing to \nChoso \u02d8n Korea, its application for specific ailments, its absence or marginal \npresence in established medical texts, and the court\u2019s concerns about its impropriety\u2014suggests that the practice was rooted in local, autochthonous \npractices. \nThough the evidence for the above hypothesis is circumstantial, the diverse \nassociations of finger severing should suffice to caution against reading the spread of the phenomenon as a straightforward indicator of Confucianization. \nOn the other hand, understanding the origins of finger severing in either \nmedical or religious terms need not deny the role the Choso \u02d8n state\u2019s own ritual \ncommemoration of filiality played in inspiring these actions. Another docu-mented finger severer was a Confucian student who, after reading an example \nof finger severing in the Illustrated Guide , decided to emulate the moral \nexemplars in this text and severed his finger to feed to his father who was \nafflicted with \u201cmadness.\u201d\n30 Committed to building a \u201cConfucian society,\u201d the \nChoso \u02d8n state, by including such acts in the Illustrated Guide, may have not only \nprovided a new rationale for undertaking such deeds, but also reinforced \n29.

By the early sixteenth century, however, the court no \nlonger dwelled on the potential \u201cunorthodoxy\u201d of finger severing. Instead, actions such as \u201cfinger severing and slicing flesh\u201d were unequivocally exemplary \nand remarkable, and as \u201cactions that not everyone can reach,\u201d were thus \ndeserving of commemoration.\n33 Public demonstration may have encouraged \nemulation, but ostentation created a separate set of problems. The spread of \nthese practices was not always interpreted in a glowing light. In the annotations \nto a Veritable Records  entry from 1555, the compiler commented on the \nproliferation of filial children and chaste wives.\nA child to his parents is as a wife is to her husband. Their basis is the same. Unless \nit is someone who is completely without morals, if one\u2019s [parent or husband] is on the brink of death, one will out of desperation try to save them without regard to \nanything else, and will not bother with one\u2019s own hair, flesh, limbs or body. And \nso, those who would cut their thighs or sever their fingers are not in themselves particularly praiseworthy, it is just that, as a child or as a wife, they do not think \nabout themselves. However, now we are in a troubled age, full of falsehood. \nCustoms and morality grow corrupt and the hearts of men become conniving. Among them, there must be many who did these things in search of honor and recognition, and not because of what was originally in their hearts.\n34 \n31. How one understands the success of state efforts in encouraging emulation partly depends on \nthe question of reach. Martina Deuchler, for example, has noted that the initial effect of these texts on society at large was \u201capparently slight\u201d (Deuchler 2003, 146). It should be noted that the dissemination of the Illustrated Guides was only one mechanism of encouragement. Memorial \ngates erected throughout the country, such as the one in the provincial town of Kwaksan \ndedicated to Kim Sawo\u02d8 l, may have had a potentially more significant role in propagating these \nideas beyond the confines of a literate and elite audience.

For this annalist, ostentatious commemoration may have only encouraged the aping of the deed and not the sincere emulation of its moral sentiment. While Sejong had reluctantly permitted the commemoration of unorthodox behavior by emphasizing the authenticity of the feelings that motivated them, the problem now shifted from one of praxis and orthodoxy to one of authenticity: whether proper actions reflected true feeling. Finger severing, as an act, was no longer the problem. \nThis shift in the nature of these anxieties suggests a parallel ideological shift \nin which finger severing, both as an act of filial (and conjugal) devotion came to be normalized within a Confucian frame of reference. The existence of this shift is reinforced by the adoption of these methods by the royal family. When King Injong (r. 1544-1555) was on his deathbed, his soon-to-be widowed queen attempted to sever her finger in order to resuscitate him, only to be dissuaded by court doctors who said, \u201csuch an act will have no benefit to this disease.\u201d\n35 \nOn his mother\u2019s deathbed in 1635, Prince Sohyo \u02d8n \u662d\u986f also tried to sever his \nfinger, but was stopped by his father.36 As King Injo (r. 1623-1649) was dying, \nKing Hyojong (r. 1649-1659), then the crown prince, was seen with his \u201cfinger on his left hand dripping blood, probably because he had attempted to sever his finger, but was stopped by the grand prince, so that he did not cut through the bone.\u201d\n37 If finger severing, as Cho \u02d8ng Ilyo \u02d8ng has argued, had originated as a \ndesperate measure taken by individuals on the \u201cmargins\u201d of society, then early Choso \u02d8n likely saw not only a gradual increase in the frequency of filial cannibalism, but also its movement from the \u201cfringe\u201d of orthodoxy to the center of social normalcy.\n38 \nAs concerns about its appropriateness as an act faded with continued state \ncommemoration, the original medical and religious connotations may have receded as well.

Cho\u02d8 ng understands the commemoration of finger severing to be correlated to the social\nbackground of the filial children in question. Showing that finger cutters were more likely to be \nnon-elites or women, Cho\u02d8 ng argues that as an originally \u201cunorthodox\u201d action, its com-\nmemoration was a way of celebrating the virtue of non-elite members of society (2010, 83-92).\n190    Wang Sixiang\nor a desire for social recognition, finger severing increased in social visibility, if \nnot in actual frequency, through early Choso \u02d8n. When the Choso \u02d8n court \ncompiled the The New, Expanded Illustrated Guide to the Three Bonds of the \nEastern Country in 1617, over one third of those honored for finger severing (83 out of 203) had been rewarded since the accession of Kwanghaegun in \n1608.\n39 Would-be filial children may have no longer heard of such remedies \nfrom practicing healers, but rather through public and visible displays of filial behavior sponsored by the Choso \u02d8n court through an array of memorial gates \nand texts.\nIn rewarding emulation, the Choso \u02d8n court may have partly stripped the \noriginal, though \u201cunorthodox,\u201d medical and religious context of this practice and imbued it with a new sort of meaning. Through this shift, finger severing \nbecame acknowledged as a legitimate and acceptable means for demonstrating \nfilial behavior. This change, however, was made possible by the emergence of a separate discourse, one that emphasized not so much the appropriateness of \nparticular actions, but the authenticity of emotion. \nFilial Cannibalism and Orthodoxy in Ming Envoy Poetry\nThe social evolution of filial cannibalism, a practice that occupied a tenuous \nposition in the Confucian canon and associated with \u201cheterodox\u201d religious \npractices and fringe medical lore, calls attention to problems of orthodoxy in \nthe Choso \u02d8n state\u2019s civilizing project. The Ming literati who came to Choso \u02d8n bore witness to this project in their eulogies of Kim Sawo \u02d8l. Though invariably \npraising, these encomiums had to reconcile canonical injunctions against bodily \nharm with the act of filial finger severing. \nThe following exchange between the 1582 Ming envoy Huang Hongxian \n\u9ec3\u6d2a\u61b2  (fl. 1571) and the Choso \u02d8n Confucian scholar Yi I \u674e\u73e5 (1536-1584) \nillustrates this point. Huang wrote the following as a preface to his poems:\nCutting one\u2019s own flesh to feed one\u2019s parents is not filial. These affairs are not seen \nin the classics.

There are also twenty-eight more from the reign of King So\u02d8 njo (r. 1567-1608). See TGSS 5.41-\n5.90; 6-1-6.17.

On the other hand, even great \nmen such as Han Gaozu \u6f22\u9ad8\u7956  (?-195) and Wen Jiao \u6eab\u5da0 (288-329), who were \nwilling to cast aside filial devotion for their political goals, would feel their \nvirtue deficient in the face of a woman who willingly brought harm to herself \nfor the sake of a parent.41 For Huang, Sawo \u02d8l\u2019s act, hardly an unequivocal \nexample of filial devotion, was only laudable when relativized against negative \nexamples of historical figures who discarded filial feeling in the name of \npolitical gain or reputation. \nYi I\u2019s response to Huang reframed the conversation and avoided direct \ndiscussion of either the early Ming prohibition or the appropriateness of com-memoration. In his reply, Yi turned to a narrative of filiality that emphasized \nthe emotional authenticity of filial devotion: \nHear ye! How could this be done for the mere sake of reputation? \nShe knew only to learn from her mother and tend to her lapel and tassels.42 \nI only regret that this pinch of blood, Could not recompense the love of three springs for an inch of grass.\n43 \nDescribing the natural debt a child owes the parent, Yi allowed blood to \nbecome controvertible as a currency of filial recompense; but, in emphasizing its \nultimate inadequacy, the poem implied that such actions were the least one \n40.

The accommodation, as such, \nwas a mutual one and may partly explain how \u201ccounter-hegemonic\u201d narratives \nof filiality inspired by Buddhism and shamanism persisted in late Choso \u02d8n popular culture: they were legitimized by a state-sponsored, hegemonic \ndiscourse of filiality as a Confucian value (Haboush 2005, 132, 142-151, 175-\n177).\n The Filial Daughter of Kwaksan     197    \nGender and Empire\nThe poetic sanitization of finger severing involved not only the reinvention of \nSawo \u02d8l\u2019s motives, but reframing the context in which she was to be understood. \nHer eulogizers drew from examples of filial daughters from canonical sources. \nTwo Han period paragons, Cao E \u66f9\u5a25 (130-143), and Chunyu Tiying \u6df3\u4e8e\u7df9\u7e08  \n(fl. 167 BCE), remembered for their willingness to put their own lives on the \nline for their fathers, emerge as Kim Sawo \u02d8l\u2019s antecedents.57 \nTiying\u2019s father, about to be punished for a crime, lamented his lack of sons \nand scolded \u201chis daughters for being of no use.\u201d Tiying, spurred on by her \nfather\u2019s indignation, rose to the occasion and came to the emperor\u2019s court in \nperson to ask for clemency, offering to take her father\u2019s place in punishment.58 \nShi Dao took what motivated Tiying to \u201ctake her father\u2019s place to give up life, with life she would him repay,\u201d to be analogous to what led \u201cLady Kim to sever \nher fingers to cure her mother.\u201d The authentic emotion shared by the two filial \ndaughters made it impossible for the finger severing to have been done because \n\u201cshe heard a rumor that it would be effective.\u201d\n59 In his praise of Sawo \u02d8l, the \n1573 Ming envoy Cheng Xian \u6210\u61b2 chided Tiying\u2019s father, asking \u201cwhy is [it] \nthat the hearts of parents / value sons but do not value girls?\u201d He compared \nthese virtuous daughters, \u201cthe children who cleaved their fingers\u201d to Han \nGaozu, the \u201cson who asked for stew\u201d (see note 41), elevating them as virtuous \nparagons who surpassed men in their actions.60 In both these cases, the story", "doc_id": "92dea14e-b9a1-4ec2-9a53-48881d362649", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "ff7a7347d7248bc15ae00850849dfe3046e363ba29c4c8b89fd03adad47a36be", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 79915, "end": 83424}, "relationships": {"1": "22b60d7a-df6b-4c62-8418-43be518f4727", "2": "41c76b01-71e3-44bd-9d29-cd02665a6080", "3": "ec4f7f97-e4db-48aa-9aaf-36387a4e0a9c"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "ec4f7f97-e4db-48aa-9aaf-36387a4e0a9c": {"__data__": {"text": "Kim to sever \nher fingers to cure her mother.\u201d The authentic emotion shared by the two filial \ndaughters made it impossible for the finger severing to have been done because \n\u201cshe heard a rumor that it would be effective.\u201d\n59 In his praise of Sawo \u02d8l, the \n1573 Ming envoy Cheng Xian \u6210\u61b2 chided Tiying\u2019s father, asking \u201cwhy is [it] \nthat the hearts of parents / value sons but do not value girls?\u201d He compared \nthese virtuous daughters, \u201cthe children who cleaved their fingers\u201d to Han \nGaozu, the \u201cson who asked for stew\u201d (see note 41), elevating them as virtuous \nparagons who surpassed men in their actions.60 In both these cases, the story of \nTiying legitimizes Sawo \u02d8l\u2019s finger severing not simply by providing another example of a virtuous daughter, but by contextualizing finger severing as a form \nof filial sacrifice.\n61\nThe story of Cao E functions similarly in this context.

The 1521 \nenvoy Tang Gao \u5510\u768b (1469-1526), for example, offered this fanciful vignette of \nan imagined encounter with Sawo \u02d8l\u2019s ghost: \nAt midnight who comes to knock on the door to my bedroom? \nIt must have been the young woman\u2019s spirit, not yet dispersed. It was the spring wind that came through, all without intention, \nTo give thanks to the poems that remember her deeds.\n78\nTang\u2019s poem combined the literary trope of a lingering ghost who remained in \nthe human world because of unrequited emotions with the hagiography of a \nfilial daughter. By assuring it was really only a \u201cspring wind\u201d and not a ghost, \nthe poem transferred the affective power of emotion present in eulogies of filial \nchildren to the actions of the Ming envoy. The power of poetry to represent and \nrecognize, not the filial act itself, took center stage. Gong Yongqing, for example, felt duty-bound to represent Kim Sawo \u02d8l in verse. Calling Kwaksan an \n\u201cempty mountain\u201d difficult to find, Gong lamented the \u201clost site\u201d of her \n\u201cbroken stele strewn among fallen flowers and wild grasses\u201d (\n\u843d\u82b1\u8352\u8349\u81e5\u6b98\u7891 ). \nHis romanticized account of discovering an allegedly hidden locale again \nunderscored the power of his writing, for without his \u201cwriting poems for her,\u201d \n\u201cshe would have fallen into obscurity in this eastern land.\u201d79 \nRather than dismiss envoy poetry for the self-congratulatory tone that often \npervades its lines, it should be noted that such notions of self-importance were reinforced by their Choso \u02d8n hosts. In his response to Gong, the Choso \u02d8n official So Seyang articulated the relationship between Sawo \u02d8l\u2019s filiality, the Ming\u2019s \nimperial project, and the role of the Ming envoy:\n[...] The envoy in one gaze gathers the people\u2019s customs, \nFor a myriad ages, his writing will be as the seas and mountains.

This poem, in charging the Ming envoy with \nthe duty of representation, echoed the claims to literary power made by the \nMing officials themselves. So, associating their writing with the \u201cCry of \nFishhawks\u201d (\u201cguanju\u201d \u95dc\u96ce), the first poem of the Airs of the States ( Guofeng \n\u570b\u98a8), one of the definitive classical expressions of the canonical and moral \nimperatives connected to writing, elevated their literary activities by seeing them as the continuation of a hallowed, ancient goal.\n81 Like the Airs, reputed to have \nbeen collected by Confucius from the vassals of the Zhou, their poetry exchanges were to reflect the social mores of Choso \u02d8n. The filial daughter of Kwaksan, \namong other paragons, demonstrated the attainment of Choso \u02d8n as a civilized \nstate. While the hierarchical implications of this analogy\u2014the Ming as the \nZhou, and the Choso \u02d8n as a vassal state\u2014were clear, it also revived the image of the classical, ideal past in the current world, a revival that had come about \nthrough Choso \u02d8n\u2019s civilizing project.\nThis process of co-construction, turning to literature itself as the origins of \nthe civilizing project, converted the political relationship between the Choso \u02d8n and the Ming into one that served a larger purpose. Their activities were to be \npart and parcel of a grand reenactment of the classical past. In what has been \ndescribed as \u201cusing literature to adorn the state\u201d (munjang hwa guk \n\u6587\u7ae0\u83ef\u570b ) \nthe poems in these anthologies become in and of themselves the mechanisms of the civilizing project (Sin 2010, 158-159).

Fundamentally, both the Choso \u02d8n state and the Ming \nenvoys\u2019 attempt to appropriate Kim Sawo \u02d8l\u2019s actions rested upon the same poetic \nlogic.

Stephen Owen (1992, chap. 1-2) discusses the significance of this text and the Airs of the \nStates in the literary tradition. \n206    Wang Sixiang\nMing\u2019s civilizing power beyond its own territory, the Choso \u02d8n court saw in Kim \nSawo \u02d8l a tangible example of the success of their own social reforms.\nConclusion\nFor the envoys of Choso \u02d8n-Ming diplomacy, Sawo \u02d8l acquired a whole range of \nsignificance beyond the scope of filial devotion. Although a hundred-odd poems \nis no small number, Sawo \u02d8l remained a largely localized figure, remembered in \nKwaksan within the space of envoy poetry, as one among many filial children \nmentioned in the Illustrated Guides. Sawo \u02d8l\u2019s significance to our understanding \nof Choso \u02d8n society lies not in the rather limited horizontal diffusion of this \nfigure, but rather her vertical depth: Sawo \u02d8l\u2019s filial act strung together several \ndiscursive and social layers and offered glimpses into different kinds of \nprocesses. From the provincial town of Kwaksan to the Choso \u02d8n court and the banquet table of a diplomatic mission, Sawo \u02d8l was the combined cultural \nproduct of local and popular practice, the Choso \u02d8n court\u2019s civilizing project, and \na high imperial poetic mode. \nFiliality in Choso \u02d8n society, as embodied in Sawo \u02d8l\u2019s severed finger, carried a \nwide range of meanings, but they converged on the importance of authentic feeling. Both envoy poets and Choso \u02d8n officials came to focus on the filial \nemotions that motivated the act. The rhetorical strategies in envoy poetry \nexhibited a congruity with the historical processes initiated by the Choso \u02d8n state that gradually integrated a once problematic act into social normalcy. The \nshared strategies of cultural legitimation in these distinct, though related, \ndiscursive contexts hint at the proliferation of not just common attitudes, but also hermeneutic patterns and structures of relevance. Such congruity is not \nsurprising, given that the writers of envoy poetry, their anthologizers, and the \ncompilers of these collections of moral deeds were sometimes the very same \ncourt officials.\n82\nHowever, the marginalization of the heterodox thus achieved may have only \noccurred on the page.

Just as \na Korean Confucian could take a case of finger severing by a commoner as an \n82. The compiler of the 1617 anthology was Yu Ku\u02d8 n \u67f3\u6839 (1549-1627), who was also the chief \nwelcoming emissary for the 1606 and 1609 Ming embassies (Du 2010, 18-10).\n The Filial Daughter of Kwaksan     207    \nauthentication of a Confucian value, viewed from a distance, in the eyes of a \nMing envoy, Choso \u02d8n\u2019s project of Confucianization itself authenticated the \nMing\u2019s own civilizing project. Ming officials disregarded local difference and \nunderstood the finger severing on their own terms, which their hosts were eager \nto confirm. When made to bear witness to the act of finger severing, Ming \nenvoys took a phenomenon that had its own historical specificity in Choso \u02d8n \nand understood it as a manifestation of what they perceived to be a universal \nideal. Their Choso \u02d8n hosts played along, and the universality of filiality so \nexpressed, \u201c... for all eternity, moral order hangs above like the sun and moon, / a filial heart was from the beginning no different between man and woman,\u201d \nproduced a seeming convergence of Choso \u02d8n and Ming practices.\n83 \nThe irony of this claim to universality was that the value of filial devotion \nwas not only a moral ideal for all to follow, but that it may really have been \navailable for anyone to interpret. Against the backdrop of state orthodoxy, \npopular narratives such as the Song of Sim Ch\u2019o \u02d8ng, Buddhist parables, and \nshaman songs, containing alternative, counter-hegemonic belief systems thrived (Haboush 1995). But this may very well be because of the process of \naccommodation, which we witness in the case of finger severing, was achieved \nwith an emphasis on \u201cauthentic feeling\u201d over the details of doctrine, such that alternate meanings of filiality could persist in tandem with official, public \ninterpretations.\nAs this discussion has tried to show, however, filial cannibalism in Korea \nand China was not only different in the specifics of practice, but also in the \nmechanisms of its dispersion. What emerged as a \u201ccommon\u201d Confucian culture between the Choso \u02d8n and the Ming, then, was not so much a direct product of cultural transmission, nor a self-evident elaboration of classical notions, but a \nmore subtle interplay between various processes. The Ming did not bring \nConfucianism to Korea, nor could shared classical texts (like the Classic of Filial \nPiety) guarantee identical developments. Instead, literary production, diplomacy, state initiative, along with the slower processes of social transformation, interacted in complex ways to give credence to these narratives.\nThese hegemonic narratives of civilization, whether centered in Choso \u02d8n or in \nthe Ming, have in common the disembodiment of individual actions from their \noriginal reference of meaning.

While chastity fell upon women and loyalty was meaningful for elite men, all human beings were children of \nsome parents. This paper will investigate filiality in early Choso \u02d8n Korea through one \nrelatively obscure figure, Kim Sawo \u02d8l. Severing her finger and feeding it to her ailing mother, Kim\u2019s remarkable act of filial devotion earned the recognition of the Choso \u02d8n court. Though not the only finger severer in Choso \u02d8n, a fact of geography propelled her \nto renown among the generations of Ming envoys who passed by her hometown, many \nof whom left poems in her honor. Both the Ming envoys and the Choso \u02d8n court, however, had to grapple with the potentially heterodox implications of her cannibalistic filial act. Not only did finger severing have resonances with Buddhist notions, local \nreligious traditions, and fringe medical lore, but it directly contradicted classical \nConfucian injunctions against \u201cself-harm.\u201d The resolution of this problem, in both the envoy poetry and the Choso \u02d8n social context, involved reinterpretations and rewritings that converted a problematic category of behavior into symbols of a Confucian civilizing \nproject by emphasizing the affective power of sincere filial emotion. This mechanism of \nconversion and accommodation may partly explain how local differences and alternative cosmologies persisted in the context of Confucian hegemony in Choso \u02d8n Korea. \nKeywords:  Filiality, envoy poetry, cannibalism, Samgang haengsil to, Confucianism, \nearly Choso \u02d8n\n176    Wang Sixiang\nIntroduction\nIn 1422, King Sejong (r. 1418-1450) ordered a memorial gate (cho \u02d8ngnyo \u02d8  \u65cc\u95ad) \nbe erected in honor of a woman named Kim Sawo \u02d8l \u91d1\u56db\u6708  from the Korean \nprovincial town of Kwaksan \u90ed\u5c71. Kim had been brought to the court\u2019s attention \nbecause she had cured her mother of an illness through a remarkable feat of \nfilial devotion. Learning that the pulverized bone of a living person could cure madness, she severed her own finger and fed it to her mother as medicine.\n1 The \nrulers of Choso \u02d8n Korea (1392-1910) made it a point to recognize individuals who displayed such virtues as part of a concerted effort to propagate Confucian social norms. Besides granting rewards and emoluments associated with official recognition, these rulers also included exemplary individuals in compilations of didactic texts, the Illustrated Guide ( Haengsil to \n\u884c\u5be6\u5716 ) series.2 These compil-\nations honored individuals whose deeds exemplified the three cardinal human relationships (K. samgang, Ch. sangang \n\u4e09\u7db1) by demonstrating the correspond-\ning virtues of filiality (K. hyo, Ch. xiao \u5b5d), loyalty (K. ch\u2019ung, Ch. zhong \u5fe0), \nand chastity (K. y o\u02d8 l , Ch. lie \u70c8; Ch. jie \u7bc0) in Confucian morality.3\nUnlike loyalty to the state, generally the purview of elite men, and chastity, \nwhich only applied to women, filiality alone among these three had the potential to be universally relevant.

In later compilations of the Illustrated \nGuide, the roster of filial children expanded to include considerable numbers of non-elites: commoners and slaves, and both married and unmarried women (Cho \u02d8ng 2010, 83-89). Filiality was arguably the prime virtue in this triad, with sections devoted to its exemplars listed first in these compilations.\n4 Not \n1. Sejong sillok 16.18a [1422/06/27]. \n2. See Pak 1990 for an overview of the state reward system in the Choso\u02d8 n period. The Choso\u02d8 n \ncourt sponsored several separate editions of the Illustrated Guide series: Samgang haengsil to \u4e09\u7db1\n\u884c\u5be6\u5716 (1431), Sok Samgang haengsil to \u7e8c\u4e09\u7db1\u884c\u5be6\u5716 (1514), Tongguk Samgang haengsil to \u6771\n\u570b\u4e09\u7db1\u884c\u5be6\u5716 (1617), Tongguk sin sok Samgang haengsil to \u6771\u570b\u65b0\u7e8c\u4e09\u7db1\u884c\u5be6\u5716 (1617), and  \nOryun haengsil to \u4e94\u502b\u884c\u5be6\u5716 (1797).\n3. The terms that fall underneath the category of \u201cchastity\u201d occupy different places in Choso\u02d8 n and \nMing commemorative practice. The Ming distinguished between jie and lie as distinct categories \nand honored both with memorial gates. The first category applied to women who refused \nremarriage, while the latter often involved steadfast commitment to chastity demonstrated \nthrough death or self-mutilation. The early Chos o\u02d8n court, on the other hand, only commemorated \n\u201cyo \u02d8llyo \u02d8 :\u201d women who \u201chave revealed really extraordinary chastity\u201d (Lee 2009, 138-139); \nJungwon Kim also distinguishes between Chinese and Korean usage of these terms (Kim 2007, \n17-18; 41).\n4. The male gendering of loyalty can be seen in the circuitous manner in which the courtesan \nNon\u2019gae \u8ad6\u4ecb came to be commemorated as an exemplar of \u201cloyalty.\u201d During the Imjin War, she \n The Filial Daughter of Kwaksan     177    \nsurprisingly, the celebration of filial virtue played a pivotal role in the early \nChoso \u02d8n state\u2019s project of Confucianization. Filiality manifested as a central \nconcern accompanied shifts in mourning and burial rituals and notions of \npaternal descent, a gradual process that extended well into the seventeenth \ncentury.5 \nThe case of Kim Sawo \u02d8l offers another perspective into how filiality fit into \nthis process of Confucianization. While the Choso \u02d8n state could appeal to the Confucian canon to justify its encouragement of Confucian family rituals, her \nact of finger severing, even for an ailing parent, fell outside the purview of \nclassical prescription. When Sawo \u02d8l was finally included in the Illustrated Guide \ncompilation in 1617, she was not alone. Of the 706 filial children included, \nthere were two hundred others who, like she, had severed a finger to feed to a \nsick parent.\n6 Sawo \u02d8l\u2019s distinction from these other", "doc_id": "8aa71454-215e-4f6f-92f4-9e73cc5ce842", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "74bbbdf8ee6d973bda97c471b9458ea34c7461b97e95991bacd35277d071800a", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 2939, "end": 6093}, "relationships": {"1": "89190b63-4dca-49bf-b4b9-b3e9f77b3eb7", "2": "057c3d37-ed05-49a7-9d9b-fe477a796c3b", "3": "66eff15d-afda-4ef9-ad12-0e7633b4e746"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "66eff15d-afda-4ef9-ad12-0e7633b4e746": {"__data__": {"text": "notions of \npaternal descent, a gradual process that extended well into the seventeenth \ncentury.5 \nThe case of Kim Sawo \u02d8l offers another perspective into how filiality fit into \nthis process of Confucianization.

Imperial envoys from Ming China (1368-1644) traveling \nbetween Beijing and Seoul regularly journeyed through her hometown of \nKwaksan, a stop along the way through P\u2019yo \u02d8ngan province. On his way back to \nBeijing, the 1449 envoy Ni Qian \u502a\u8b19 (1415-1479) noticed, alongside the road, \nkilled an enemy general by embracing him and jumping into a river. Dying along with him, she \nwas remembered for this act of sacrifice. According to Jung Ji Young, a combination of her social background and gender may have excluded her from the Tongguk sin sok Samgang haengsil to \n(hereafter the TGSS) compiled in 1617. The compilation, dividing virtuous individuals into \u201cloyal subjects\u201d (ch\u2019ungsin \n\u5fe0\u81e3), \u201cfilial children\u201d (hyoja \u5b5d\u5b50), and \u201cchaste women\u201d (yo \u02d8llyo \u02d8 \u70c8\u5973), left no \nroom for Non\u2019gae, who,  as a woman, did not fit the category of a loyal minister, and as a \ncourtesan, could not be considered \u201cchaste.\u201d The state recognition of Non\u2019gae as a figure of loyalty did not come until the 18th century, after significant changes in how her story came to be interpreted and remembered (Jung 2009, 161-176). The TGSS does include examples of non-elites of both genders in its section for loyal subjects. These cases all date from the Imjin War and \ninvolve male and female slaves dying for their masters. In such cases, the master-slave relationship \nserves as an extension of the ruler-subject relationship. Notably, none of these cases involve loyalty directly to the state; neither are there elite women represented in this category. For examples of female slaves, see TGSS, ch\u2019ungsin to 1:81-85. The TGSS from 1617 will be the primary edition of \nthe Illustrated Guide series cited and referenced in this paper. As the largest compilation of these \nillustrated guides, it alone contains 706 out of 746 cases of \u201cfilial children\u201d documented in these series (Yi 2004, 203); Cho\u02d8 ng Ilyo\u02d8 ng has reviewed scholarship on these texts and written a \ncomprehensive study on the TGSS (2010, 70-74).

The commemoration of virtuous acts became more prevalent after the Imjin Wars (Lee 2009, 144-153).\n178    Wang Sixiang\na stone tablet inscribed with the words, \u201cThe Gate of the Filial Girl, Sawo \u02d8l\u201d \n(Hyonyo \u02d8 Sawo \u02d8l chi mun \u5b5d\u5973\u56db\u6708\u4e4b\u9580 ). Ni wrote the following of this encounter:\nSince it is my duty to discover good deeds, how can I not have a single word to \neulogize this? Now, if those gentlemen who have accompanied me could write a poem in response, it would do justice to the virtue of the East [i.e. Korea.] \nThe poem Ni composed, and his exhortation to follow his example, helped \ninaugurate a tradition in Choso \u02d8n-Ming diplomacy. Though not the first Ming \nliteratus to exchange poems with Koreans, Ni Qian\u2019s eagerness for recognition \noutstripped that of his predecessors. He was the first to publish his envoy poetry \nin Ming China. His anthology, the Liaohai Compilation ( Liaohai bian \u907c\u6d77\u7de8 ), \npublished in 1464, helped bring Kim Sawo \u02d8l to the attention of future Ming envoys, who in turn also wrote poems on Sawo \u02d8l as they passed her memorial \ngate. The Choso \u02d8n court\u2019s own poetry anthologies, The Collection of Brilliant \nFlowers  (Hwanghwajip  \n\u7687\u83ef\u96c6 ), a series that collected the poems of Ming \nenvoys, catalyzed these interactions by documenting the poetic accomplishments \nof their predecessors.7 \nKwaksan thus became a place where subsequent Ming envoys rendered \nhomage to the filial Sawo \u02d8l, one of the most persistent subjects of their envoy \npoetry. These anthologies fostered a sense of tradition, embedded in space and \nthrough time, providing a textual repertoire of poetic knowledge.

Vigilance in not allowing anything to do injury to \nyour person is where [filiality] begins.\u201d14 Though filial cannibalism can also be \nread as a logical extension of the notion of self-sacrifice, Ming period editions of the popular Twenty-four Filial Acts (Ch. Ershisi xiao \n\u4e8c\u5341\u56db\u5b5d ), which praised \nchildren who made personal sacrifices for their parents, did not contain any \n13. In this paper I use \u201cfilial cannibalism\u201d tentatively to describe instances of children offering \ntheir own flesh to their parents as acts of filial devotion. The term is not without its problems, since it risks conflating the \u201ccannibal\u201d i.e. the parent, with the child, the filial agent. Martha Sibau, who is critical of the term \u201ccannibalism,\u201d prefers the term \u201cfilial slicing\u201d partly because the emphasis in these filial narratives is not on the act of eating per se, but on the action of the cutting \n(2011, 105n127). \u201cFilial slicing\u201d then, is a derivation of the term used for these instances in \nChinese sources: gegu (K. halgo \n\u5272\u80a1) literally \u201cslicing the thigh (or limb),\u201d but can also refer to \nany kind of flesh cutting (Qiu 1995, 51; Yu 2008, 96). While Tina Lu generally prefers the term gegu, she notes that \u201cfiliality and cannibalism are inextricably linked\u201d in late imperial China (Lu 2008, 147-148). In the Korean context, \u201cthigh slicing\u201d often appears alongside tanji (\u201cfinger \nsevering\u201d \n\u65b7\u6307) to describe what Cho Namuk has termed yuksin hyohaeng \u8089\u8eab\u5b5d\u884c , \u201cfilial acts of \nthe body\u201d (Cho 2009, 124-145). The term \u201cfinger severing\u201d I will reserve specifically for such instances where fingers are involved, in order to distinguish the specificity of the practice in the Korean context.\n14.

Qiu Zhonglin has \nargued that while filial cannibalism began as popular practice in the Tang-Song \nperiods, it reached general social acceptance among gentry circles by the Ming. \nEven amid reluctant imperial recognition by the Qing (1644-1911), Chinese \nliterati discourse did not settle into an easy consensus regarding the propriety of \nfilial cannibalism, though there appeared to be a growing set of voices pushing for the acceptance of filial cannibalism as a legitimate practice (Qiu 1995, \n72-90). Though there was official recognition of such acts during the Ming, \nthey were also controversial. The first emperor, Ming Taizu (r. 1368-1398) had actually explicitly banned both this and similar practices and their commemor-\nation. The prohibition against \u201cthigh slicing\u201d and \u201cice sitting\u201d as acts \u201charmful \nto the body\u201d (\n\u5272\u80a1\u81e5 \u51b0 \u50b7\u8eab\u6709\u7981 ) arose from Ming Taizu\u2019s reaction to a particular \nincident involving a man who offered his own flesh to his parent, and failing \nthat, prayed to a god and killed his three year old child as an offering. When a \nlocal official proposed to honor him as a paragon of filial devotion, Ming Taizu was \u201cangered that [he] has destroyed morals and extinguished principle\u201d (\n\u6012\u5176 \n\u7d55\u502b\u6ec5\u7406 ), and instead had him flogged and exiled. The Ming emperor\u2019s \ninjunction against such behavior was rooted in the perceived incompatibility \nbetween orthodox notions of filiality and self-mutilation. The circumstances of \nthe case also suggests multivalent religious traditions and local practices may have informed behavior, even as these actions all become conflated into the \nlarger categories of \u201cmutilation\u201d (Ch. shangshen  \n\u50b7\u8eab) and \u201cviolation\u201d (Ch. \n15. Twenty-four Filial Acts, better understood as a \u201cgenre of popular works,\u201d rather than a single \ntext, has existed in various forms.

It should also be noted that there are numerous other examples of finger cutting, not as instances of filial devotion, but as cases of widows showing their resolve to refuse remarriage (Qiu 1995, 52).\n18. Qiu Zhonglin\u2019s numbers are taken from cases mentioned in the sections of the Gujin tushu \njicheng  dealing with exemplars of \u201cLearning and Deeds\u201d ( \u5b78\u884c\u5178) and exemplary \u201cWives and \nDaughters\u201d (\u95a8\u5a9b\u5178), and thus include examples from early times through the Ming. Unlike the \nIllustrated Guides in Choso\u02d8 n, these examples are collected from a variety of sources and, as one \nsection in a massive compilation, were not intended for broad dissemination. Some figures appear \nin local gazetteers or literati poetry, while only some may have received state recognition. \nAlthough these two sources document \u201cfilial cannibalism\u201d in rather different ways and for distinct purposes, making definitive comparisons difficult, the contrast in the frequency and relative occurrence of \u201cfinger severing\u201d between the two compilations is stark. According to my tabulation of cases of finger severing in the TGSS, the rates for finger severing in proportion to other acts of filial devotion over time are as follows: 5 out 64 (7.8%) cases from pre-Choso\u02d8 n, \n42/184 (22.8%/.36 commemorations per year) from before the reign of Yo\u02d8 nsan\u2019gun (1392-1494), \n73/217 (33.6%/.72) commemorations per year between the reigns of Yo\u02d8 nsan-So\u02d8 njo (1494-1608), \nand 83/240 (34.5%/10.375) in the first decade of Kwanghaegun\u2019s reign alone (1608-1617). These figures do not include cases where individuals were recognized for a different kind of filial act, but were also known to have severed their fingers. Cho\u02d8 ng argues that the publication of this particular \nsource should be understood within its context and should not simply be taken as a verbatim \n184    Wang Sixiang\nof the total.19\nThe recognition of finger severing as a specific, localized phenomenon \nreveals a distinct historical trajectory in the Confucian civilizing project of the \nearly Choso \u02d8n state. To be sure, the early Choso \u02d8n state shared reservations about \nfinger severing similar to the early Ming court\u2019s anxiety regarding filial \ncannibalism.

The continued rewarding of such actions that were \n\u201cbeyond the norm\u201d (K. kwasang  \u904e\u5e38) lead to concerns that they would \novershadow more habitual, prosaic forms of devotion that were harder to observe, but were\u2014because they reflected sincere sentiments through their \nconsistency\u2014more fundamental to filiality.\n25 In practice, however, dramatic \npractices in East Asia. When it comes to filiality, Buddhist and Confucian ideas were not \nnecessarily seen as antithetical, but rather complementary, especially for those in the late Ming who sought a synthesis of the \u201cThree Teachings,\u201d of Buddhism, Confucianism, and Daoism (L\u00fc 2011, 150-158); for a discussion of the textual history of this particular series of su \u00aftras, see Guang 2008.\n23. The first documented example of a filial child who fed his flesh to a parent was a Buddhist \nmonk from the Silla. Most examples in the TGSS do not indicate how a filial child came to be \ninspired to sever his finger. In two early examples, the child learns of the method through a dream, one visited by his sick father and the other a Buddhist monk. See TGSS v. 1.2; v. 2.19, 82. A few other cases only mention that they \u201cheard\u201d from others that \u201cthe bone of a living person\u201d could heal their parent. See TGSS v. 2.16; v. 3.17, 23. A doctor appears in another, later example: TGSS v. 6.28. For Cho\u02d8 ng Ilyo\u02d8 ng, the practice of filial cannibalism in the Korean context is explained as a \nturn to \u201csuperstitious\u201d healing methods by individuals of lower status who may not have had \naccess to medical treatment, a situation he believes to be parallel to how such acts emerged in \nChina (Ch o\u02d8ng 2010, 87). The lack of definitive or direct evidence, however, makes the \nascertainment of the precise origins of \u201cfilial cannibalism\u201d difficult in the Chinese context as well. While a general trajectory of \u201cbottom-up\u201d has been proposed (Qiu 1995, 49-51), explanations range from using human flesh as food in times of need, such as famine, to self-mortifying ascetic practices in Buddhism. Jimmy Yu relates the practice to all of the above as well as to \u201cregenerative cannibalistic sacrifices of ancient China,\u201d and \u201chermeneutic practice of medicine.\u201d He too, however, refrains from identifying one specific origin, but chooses to emphasize the potential for \nsymbiosis among different practices (Yu 2008, 100-120).

Sejong sillok 94.8b [1441/10/22]: \u201cThe act of finger severing, however, is something that goes \nbeyond the norm\u2014one need not do such a thing in order to be filial. When it comes to those who \nhave filial hearts that are pure and sincere, and serve their parents with joy, beyond reproach and going above and beyond others, they should especially be rewarded. From now one, have both the central and provincial officials recommend examples of these so that we can promote virtuous \n186    Wang Sixiang\ngestures, such as finger severing, had the convenience of visibility and offered \ntangible examples for emulation.\nThe questionable appropriateness of finger severing may also be related to \nthe medical dimension of the practice. The earliest account of Kim Sawo \u02d8l\u2019s \nactions in the Choso \u02d8n wangjo sillok describes Kim searching for a way to cure \nher mother\u2019s madness. She was told to \u201ccrush the bones of a living person\u201d and that \u201cconsuming them will have immediate results.\u201d\n26 Filial cannibalism was \nthus likely rooted in some belief that human flesh itself had intrinsic curative \nproperties. A startling case from 1546 involving a missing child illustrates this \npoint. The three-year-old\u2019s corpse was discovered after two weeks, with its right \nhand missing two fingers.

Another docu-mented finger severer was a Confucian student who, after reading an example \nof finger severing in the Illustrated Guide , decided to emulate the moral \nexemplars in this text and severed his finger to feed to his father who was \nafflicted with \u201cmadness.\u201d\n30 Committed to building a \u201cConfucian society,\u201d the \nChoso \u02d8n state, by including such acts in the Illustrated Guide, may have not only \nprovided a new rationale for undertaking such deeds, but also reinforced \n29.

Chungjong sillok 57.28a [1526/07/25].\n188    Wang Sixiang\nwhatever existing ideas the people had about its efficacy.31 Concerned that \nremote villages would not have access to the texts, King Chungjong (r. 1509-\n1544) ordered several new cases of exemplary moral behavior, including filial \ncannibalism, to be written down on notices to be distributed widely.32 Their \ninclusion in Illustrated Guide texts, accompanied with vernacular Korean, were, after all, intended to encourage exactly the kind of emulation mentioned in the \nabove anecdote.\nThese examples from the sixteenth century leave open the question of \nwhether the belief of medical efficacy arose from the circulation of local medical or religious knowledge, or was a direct result of the Choso \u02d8n state commemor-\nating finger severing. By the early sixteenth century, however, the court no \nlonger dwelled on the potential \u201cunorthodoxy\u201d of finger severing. Instead, actions such as \u201cfinger severing and slicing flesh\u201d were unequivocally exemplary \nand remarkable, and as \u201cactions that not everyone can reach,\u201d were thus \ndeserving of commemoration.\n33 Public demonstration may have encouraged \nemulation, but ostentation created a separate set of problems. The spread of \nthese practices was not always interpreted in a glowing light. In the annotations \nto a Veritable Records  entry from 1555, the compiler commented on the \nproliferation of filial children and chaste wives.\nA child to his parents is as a wife is to her husband. Their basis is the same. Unless \nit is someone who is completely without morals, if one\u2019s [parent or husband] is on the brink of death, one will out of desperation try to save them without regard to \nanything else, and will not bother with one\u2019s own hair, flesh, limbs or body. And \nso, those who would cut their thighs or sever their fingers are not in themselves particularly praiseworthy, it is just that, as a child or as a wife, they do not think \nabout themselves. However, now we are in a troubled age, full of falsehood. \nCustoms and morality grow corrupt and the hearts of men become conniving. Among them, there must be many who did these things in search of honor and recognition, and not because of what was originally in their hearts.\n34 \n31. How one understands the success of state efforts in encouraging emulation partly depends on \nthe question of reach. Martina Deuchler, for example, has noted that the initial effect of these texts on society at large was \u201capparently slight\u201d (Deuchler 2003, 146). It should be noted that the dissemination of the Illustrated Guides was only one mechanism of encouragement. Memorial \ngates erected throughout the country, such as the one in the provincial town of Kwaksan \ndedicated to Kim Sawo\u02d8 l, may have had a potentially more significant role in propagating these \nideas beyond the confines of a literate and elite audience. State commemoration in early Choso\u02d8 n \nalso involved tangible rewards such as the commutation of corv\u00e9e or tax duties, rewards of grain, \nand the granting of official titles incentivizing such behavior (Pak 1990, 30-59, 65-68). \n32.

For this annalist, ostentatious commemoration may have only \nencouraged the aping of the deed and not the sincere emulation of its moral \nsentiment. While Sejong had reluctantly permitted the commemoration of \nunorthodox behavior by emphasizing the authenticity of the feelings that \nmotivated them, the problem now shifted from one of praxis and orthodoxy to \none of authenticity: whether proper actions reflected true feeling. Finger \nsevering, as an act, was no longer the problem. \nThis shift in the nature of these anxieties suggests a parallel ideological shift \nin which finger severing, both as an act of filial (and conjugal) devotion came to be normalized within a Confucian frame of reference. The existence of this shift is reinforced by the adoption of these methods by the royal family. When King \nInjong (r. 1544-1555) was on his deathbed, his soon-to-be widowed queen \nattempted to sever her finger in order to resuscitate him, only to be dissuaded \nby court doctors who said, \u201csuch an act will have no benefit to this disease.\u201d\n35 \nOn his mother\u2019s deathbed in 1635, Prince Sohyo \u02d8n \u662d\u986f also tried to sever his \nfinger, but was stopped by his father.36 As King Injo (r. 1623-1649) was dying, \nKing Hyojong (r. 1649-1659), then the crown prince, was seen with his \u201cfinger on his left hand dripping blood, probably because he had attempted to sever his \nfinger, but was stopped by the grand prince, so that he did not cut through the \nbone.\u201d\n37 If finger severing, as Cho \u02d8ng Ilyo \u02d8ng has argued, had originated as a \ndesperate measure taken by individuals on the \u201cmargins\u201d of society, then early Choso \u02d8n likely saw not only a gradual increase in the frequency of filial \ncannibalism, but also its movement from the \u201cfringe\u201d of orthodoxy to the center of social normalcy.\n38 \nAs concerns about its appropriateness as an act faded with continued state \ncommemoration, the original medical and religious connotations may have receded as well.

When the Choso \u02d8n court \ncompiled the The New, Expanded Illustrated Guide to the Three Bonds of the \nEastern Country in 1617, over one third of those honored for finger severing (83 out of 203) had been rewarded since the accession of Kwanghaegun in \n1608.\n39 Would-be filial children may have no longer heard of such remedies \nfrom practicing healers, but rather through public and visible displays of filial behavior sponsored by the Choso \u02d8n court through an array of memorial gates \nand texts.\nIn rewarding emulation, the Choso \u02d8n court may have partly stripped the \noriginal, though \u201cunorthodox,\u201d medical and religious context of this practice and imbued it with a new sort of meaning. Through this shift, finger severing \nbecame acknowledged as a legitimate and acceptable means for demonstrating \nfilial behavior. This change, however, was made possible by the emergence of a separate discourse, one that emphasized not so much the appropriateness of \nparticular actions, but the authenticity of emotion. \nFilial Cannibalism and Orthodoxy in Ming Envoy Poetry\nThe social evolution of filial cannibalism, a practice that occupied a tenuous \nposition in the Confucian canon and associated with \u201cheterodox\u201d religious \npractices and fringe medical lore, calls attention to problems of orthodoxy in \nthe Choso \u02d8n state\u2019s civilizing project. The Ming literati who came to Choso \u02d8n bore witness to this project in their eulogies of Kim Sawo \u02d8l. Though invariably \npraising, these encomiums had to reconcile canonical injunctions against bodily \nharm with the act of filial finger severing. \nThe following exchange between the 1582 Ming envoy Huang Hongxian \n\u9ec3\u6d2a\u61b2  (fl. 1571) and the Choso \u02d8n Confucian scholar Yi I \u674e\u73e5 (1536-1584) \nillustrates this point. Huang wrote the following as a preface to his poems:\nCutting one\u2019s own flesh to feed one\u2019s parents is not filial. These affairs are not seen \nin the classics.

On the other hand, even great \nmen such as Han Gaozu \u6f22\u9ad8\u7956  (?-195) and Wen Jiao \u6eab\u5da0 (288-329), who were \nwilling to cast aside filial devotion for their political goals, would feel their \nvirtue deficient in the face of a woman who willingly brought harm to herself \nfor the sake of a parent.41 For Huang, Sawo \u02d8l\u2019s act, hardly an unequivocal \nexample of filial devotion, was only laudable when relativized against negative \nexamples of historical figures who discarded filial feeling in the name of \npolitical gain or reputation. \nYi I\u2019s response to Huang reframed the conversation and avoided direct \ndiscussion of either the early Ming prohibition or the appropriateness of com-memoration. In his reply, Yi turned to a narrative of filiality that emphasized \nthe emotional authenticity of filial devotion: \nHear ye! How could this be done for the mere sake of reputation? \nShe knew only to learn from her mother and tend to her lapel and tassels.42 \nI only regret that this pinch of blood, Could not recompense the love of three springs for an inch of grass.\n43 \nDescribing the natural debt a child owes the parent, Yi allowed blood to \nbecome controvertible as a currency of filial recompense; but, in emphasizing its \nultimate inadequacy, the poem implied that such actions were the least one \n40.

This halcyon \nfamily life created a context out of which Sawo \u02d8l\u2019s filial behavior naturally \nemerged. \n[...] The doctor said, if one uses human flesh, \nAnd feeds it to her, the illness will surely stop.

If the Buddhist and shamanistic elements that drive later \npopular narratives of filial devotion in Choso \u02d8n Korea, such as the Song of Sim \nCh\u2019o \u02d8ng, are any indication, the elaboration of the cult of filiality in Choso \u02d8n was \nnot so much the result of state efforts to spread filial behavior as a Confucian \ndoctrine, but rather the reframing (and thereby sanctioning) of existing practices \nas Confucian behavior.

Looking from the \ntop down, those who held Confucian ideals integrated specific behaviors, which \nmay have carried varied sets of meanings, into one streamlined narrative by \ninsisting on one interpretative code. From the bottom up, narratives of filiality infused with Buddhist and shamanistic notions were in fact interfacing with \nstate-oriented and elite narratives, appropriating those discourses to their own \ncosmologies. This dialectic interaction between diverse particularities and the hegemonic ideologies that subsume them may be compared to processes in \nother social and historical contexts, such as the interplay between changing \nburial rites and the authority of the church played in the rise of the cult of the saints in early Christian Europe, or the continuous reinventions of a local \nreligious cult amidst the social and political transformations in Tokugawa and \nMeiji Japan (Brown 1982, 23-49; Thal 2005). The accommodation, as such, \nwas a mutual one and may partly explain how \u201ccounter-hegemonic\u201d narratives \nof filiality inspired by Buddhism and shamanism persisted in late Choso \u02d8n popular culture: they were legitimized by a state-sponsored, hegemonic \ndiscourse of filiality as a Confucian value (Haboush 2005, 132, 142-151, 175-\n177).\n The Filial Daughter of Kwaksan     197    \nGender and Empire\nThe poetic sanitization of finger severing involved not only the reinvention of \nSawo \u02d8l\u2019s motives, but reframing the context in which she was to be understood. \nHer eulogizers drew from examples of filial daughters from canonical sources. \nTwo Han period paragons, Cao E \u66f9\u5a25 (130-143), and Chunyu Tiying \u6df3\u4e8e\u7df9\u7e08  \n(fl. 167 BCE), remembered for their willingness to put their own lives on the \nline for their fathers, emerge as Kim Sawo \u02d8l\u2019s antecedents.57 \nTiying\u2019s father, about to be punished for a crime, lamented his lack of sons \nand scolded \u201chis daughters for being of no use.\u201d Tiying, spurred on by her \nfather\u2019s indignation, rose to the occasion and came to the emperor\u2019s court in \nperson to ask for clemency, offering to take her father\u2019s place in punishment.58 \nShi Dao took what motivated Tiying to \u201ctake her father\u2019s place to give up life, with life she would him repay,\u201d to be analogous to what led \u201cLady Kim to sever \nher fingers to cure her mother.\u201d The authentic emotion shared by the two filial \ndaughters made it impossible for the finger severing to have been done because \n\u201cshe heard a rumor that it would be effective.\u201d\n59 In his praise of Sawo \u02d8l, the \n1573 Ming envoy Cheng Xian \u6210\u61b2 chided Tiying\u2019s father, asking \u201cwhy is [it] \nthat the hearts of parents / value sons but do not value girls?\u201d He compared \nthese virtuous daughters, \u201cthe children who cleaved their fingers\u201d to Han \nGaozu, the \u201cson who asked for stew\u201d (see note 41), elevating them as virtuous \nparagons", "doc_id": "98cd90e2-e36d-463f-9fbf-bd69d011f142", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "27ac18ccac6f2c08743b2108af0ab12b985d1c278f967ee55f92c95db9c8f4b6", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 79884, "end": 83389}, "relationships": {"1": "89190b63-4dca-49bf-b4b9-b3e9f77b3eb7", "2": "e1e0e615-b617-4c94-95a6-1c48031dcf83", "3": "83a9e90b-0f71-4aee-9e2b-5c429891ac23"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "83a9e90b-0f71-4aee-9e2b-5c429891ac23": {"__data__": {"text": "would him repay,\u201d to be analogous to what led \u201cLady Kim to sever \nher fingers to cure her mother.\u201d The authentic emotion shared by the two filial \ndaughters made it impossible for the finger severing to have been done because \n\u201cshe heard a rumor that it would be effective.\u201d\n59 In his praise of Sawo \u02d8l, the \n1573 Ming envoy Cheng Xian \u6210\u61b2 chided Tiying\u2019s father, asking \u201cwhy is [it] \nthat the hearts of parents / value sons but do not value girls?\u201d He compared \nthese virtuous daughters, \u201cthe children who cleaved their fingers\u201d to Han \nGaozu, the \u201cson who asked for stew\u201d (see note 41), elevating them as virtuous \nparagons who surpassed men in their actions.60 In both these cases, the story of \nTiying legitimizes Sawo \u02d8l\u2019s finger severing not simply by providing another example of a virtuous daughter, but by contextualizing finger severing as a form \nof filial sacrifice.\n61\nThe story of Cao E functions similarly in this context.

One of the critiques of the practice, captured in Li Shizhen\u2019s diatribe against filial cannibalism in the \nBencao, was the problem of the grief that the healed parents would feel upon \nseeing the injured body of their child.\n70 The following poem by Shi Dao treats \nthe problem of grief, building up a narrative that culminated in the mother\u2019s wailing; but the emotional climax is interrupted: \n[...] The girl\u2019s finger, once it enters the mouth of the mother, \nHeals her body and she comes to life again. Though she did not see what drug was used, \nWithout asking about the missing finger, \nThe loving mother knew what had come about, And her sudden wails moved the neighbors!\nThe grieved cries of Sawo \u02d8l\u2019s mother, who just discovered that her daughter had \nmutilated herself for her sake, gave way to a celebration of Choso \u02d8n\u2019s civilizing \nproject. \nThe vassal king affirms the teaching of proper names \nAnd, the filial principles extend to the people of the East [i.e. Korea]. Praise and exaltation are done according to model of sages, \nAnd the mores of the East are thus persisted. \nThe story of the filial girl is now old, [But] her name will live for a thousand ages.\n71\n70.

By assuring it was really only a \u201cspring wind\u201d and not a ghost, \nthe poem transferred the affective power of emotion present in eulogies of filial \nchildren to the actions of the Ming envoy. The power of poetry to represent and \nrecognize, not the filial act itself, took center stage. Gong Yongqing, for example, felt duty-bound to represent Kim Sawo \u02d8l in verse. Calling Kwaksan an \n\u201cempty mountain\u201d difficult to find, Gong lamented the \u201clost site\u201d of her \n\u201cbroken stele strewn among fallen flowers and wild grasses\u201d (\n\u843d\u82b1\u8352\u8349\u81e5\u6b98\u7891 ). \nHis romanticized account of discovering an allegedly hidden locale again \nunderscored the power of his writing, for without his \u201cwriting poems for her,\u201d \n\u201cshe would have fallen into obscurity in this eastern land.\u201d79 \nRather than dismiss envoy poetry for the self-congratulatory tone that often \npervades its lines, it should be noted that such notions of self-importance were reinforced by their Choso \u02d8n hosts. In his response to Gong, the Choso \u02d8n official So Seyang articulated the relationship between Sawo \u02d8l\u2019s filiality, the Ming\u2019s \nimperial project, and the role of the Ming envoy:\n[...] The envoy in one gaze gathers the people\u2019s customs, \nFor a myriad ages, his writing will be as the seas and mountains.

The filial daughter of Kwaksan, \namong other paragons, demonstrated the attainment of Choso \u02d8n as a civilized \nstate. While the hierarchical implications of this analogy\u2014the Ming as the \nZhou, and the Choso \u02d8n as a vassal state\u2014were clear, it also revived the image of the classical, ideal past in the current world, a revival that had come about \nthrough Choso \u02d8n\u2019s civilizing project.\nThis process of co-construction, turning to literature itself as the origins of \nthe civilizing project, converted the political relationship between the Choso \u02d8n and the Ming into one that served a larger purpose.

Stephen Owen (1992, chap. 1-2) discusses the significance of this text and the Airs of the \nStates in the literary tradition. \n206    Wang Sixiang\nMing\u2019s civilizing power beyond its own territory, the Choso \u02d8n court saw in Kim \nSawo \u02d8l a tangible example of the success of their own social reforms.\nConclusion\nFor the envoys of Choso \u02d8n-Ming diplomacy, Sawo \u02d8l acquired a whole range of \nsignificance beyond the scope of filial devotion. Although a hundred-odd poems \nis no small number, Sawo \u02d8l remained a largely localized figure, remembered in \nKwaksan within the space of envoy poetry, as one among many filial children \nmentioned in the Illustrated Guides. Sawo \u02d8l\u2019s significance to our understanding \nof Choso \u02d8n society lies not in the rather limited horizontal diffusion of this \nfigure, but rather her vertical depth: Sawo \u02d8l\u2019s filial act strung together several \ndiscursive and social layers and offered glimpses into different kinds of \nprocesses. From the provincial town of Kwaksan to the Choso \u02d8n court and the banquet table of a diplomatic mission, Sawo \u02d8l was the combined cultural \nproduct of local and popular practice, the Choso \u02d8n court\u2019s civilizing project, and \na high imperial poetic mode. \nFiliality in Choso \u02d8n society, as embodied in Sawo \u02d8l\u2019s severed finger, carried a \nwide range of meanings, but they converged on the importance of authentic feeling. Both envoy poets and Choso \u02d8n officials came to focus on the filial \nemotions that motivated the act. The rhetorical strategies in envoy poetry \nexhibited a congruity with the historical processes initiated by the Choso \u02d8n state that gradually integrated a once problematic act into social normalcy. The \nshared strategies of cultural legitimation in these distinct, though related, \ndiscursive contexts hint at the proliferation of not just common attitudes, but also hermeneutic patterns and structures of relevance. Such congruity is not \nsurprising, given that the writers of envoy poetry, their anthologizers, and the \ncompilers of these collections of moral deeds were sometimes the very same \ncourt officials.\n82\nHowever, the marginalization of the heterodox thus achieved may have only \noccurred on the page.

The \u201cauthenticity of filial emotion\u201d and the \u201csympathetic resonance of nature,\u201d notions used to describe filial cannibalism, may have \nsanitized the discourse and flattened unseemly diversities, but the assumption \nthat performed actions authenticated filial emotions was a tenuous one. Just as \na Korean Confucian could take a case of finger severing by a commoner as an \n82. The compiler of the 1617 anthology was Yu Ku\u02d8 n \u67f3\u6839 (1549-1627), who was also the chief \nwelcoming emissary for the 1606 and 1609 Ming embassies (Du 2010, 18-10).\n The Filial Daughter of Kwaksan     207    \nauthentication of a Confucian value, viewed from a distance, in the eyes of a \nMing envoy, Choso \u02d8n\u2019s project of Confucianization itself authenticated the \nMing\u2019s own civilizing project. Ming officials disregarded local difference and \nunderstood the finger severing on their own terms, which their hosts were eager \nto confirm. When made to bear witness to the act of finger severing, Ming \nenvoys took a phenomenon that had its own historical specificity in Choso \u02d8n \nand understood it as a manifestation of what they perceived to be a universal \nideal. Their Choso \u02d8n hosts played along, and the universality of filiality so \nexpressed, \u201c... for all eternity, moral order hangs above like the sun and moon, / a filial heart was from the beginning no different between man and woman,\u201d \nproduced a seeming convergence of Choso \u02d8n and Ming practices.\n83 \nThe irony of this claim to universality was that the value of filial devotion \nwas not only a moral ideal for all to follow, but that it may really have been \navailable for anyone to interpret. Against the backdrop of state orthodoxy, \npopular narratives such as the Song of Sim Ch\u2019o \u02d8ng, Buddhist parables, and \nshaman songs, containing alternative, counter-hegemonic belief systems thrived (Haboush 1995). But this may very well be because of the process of \naccommodation, which we witness in the case of finger severing, was achieved \nwith an emphasis on \u201cauthentic feeling\u201d over the details of doctrine, such that alternate meanings of filiality could persist in tandem with official, public \ninterpretations.\nAs this discussion has tried to show, however, filial cannibalism in Korea \nand China was not only different in the specifics of practice, but also in the \nmechanisms of its dispersion. What emerged as a \u201ccommon\u201d Confucian culture between the Choso \u02d8n and the Ming, then, was not so much a direct product of cultural transmission, nor a self-evident elaboration of classical notions, but a \nmore subtle interplay between various processes. The Ming did not bring \nConfucianism to Korea, nor could shared classical texts (like the Classic of Filial \nPiety) guarantee identical developments. Instead, literary production, diplomacy, state initiative, along with the slower processes of social transformation, interacted in complex ways to give credence to these narratives.\nThese hegemonic narratives of civilization, whether centered in Choso \u02d8n or in \nthe Ming, have in common the disembodiment of individual actions from their \noriginal reference of meaning.

Interpreters of spoken Chinese, for example, facilitated diplomatic con-tact with Ming China (\u660e 1368\u20131644), mediating between Chos\u014fn and Ming courtiers, who, despite sharing a common written heritage, could not speak each other\u2019s languages. The significant roles played by these interpreters, how-ever, did not necessarily bring them social or political prestige. They were ex-cluded from the center of political power and largely barred from the civil service examinations that accorded the greatest eminence at the Chos\u014fn court. The skill that they mastered\u2014spoken language\u2014came to be denigrated as an area of knowledge unfit for aristocratic pursuit.2 These interpreters, thus, embodied a series of tensions that characterized the linguistic landscape of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. While the social obscurity of interpret-ers belied their political indispensability, in a context where the universality of writing was privileged over the particulars of speech, interpretation was both the mechanism of overcoming linguistic difference and the very marker that exposed it. \n1 I want to thank Professor Benjamin Elman and the PIIRS-EAS research cluster for making this \nproject possible.

To fully appreciate this connection, the problem of language must be rescued from two prevailing narratives: first, the alleged and often assumed teleology of inevitable \u201cvernacularization\u201d that has tended to dominate studies of language issues in Chos\u014fn Korea and, second, the privileging of written over spoken lan-guage in the diplomatic record.\nThe first narrative essentially sees the elevation of the Korean alphabet from \na \u201cvernacular\u201d script (\u014fnmun \u8afa\u6587) to the medium of a national language \n(kungmun \u570b\u6587) as a natural outgrowth of the alphabet\u2019s invention in the  \n3 W hile the term \u201cvernacular\u201d has its problems, for the purposes of this chapter I use it generally \nas an equivalent to the Korean expression \u014fnmun \u8afa\u6587 , which was used to refer to the Korean \nalphabet during the Chos\u014fn period. As for different registers of the Chinese language, I use \nthe term \u201cspoken Chinese\u201d to refer generally to what appears in late Kory\u014f and Chos\u014fn period primary sources as han\u014f \u6f22\u8a9e  or hwa\u014f \u83ef\u8a9e , which is to be contrasted with literary or classical \nwriting. As Shang Wei\u2019s chapter in this volume, \u201cWriting and Speech: Rethinking the Issue of Vernaculars in Early Modern China,\u201d shows, the situation becomes more complicated for textual renderings of nonliterary registers, such as oral edicts (kouyu \u53e3\u8aed), clerical writing \n(liwen/imun \u540f\u6587), oral records (yulu \u8a9e\u9304), or other texts written in so-called baihua \u767d\u8a71.

For the early Chos\u014fn court, each of these represented some form of spoken Chinese that was the purview of specialists such as interpreters. In the case of clerical writing, the Chos\u014fn court received missives from Chinese bureaus in this documentary style and maintained an agency, the Office of Diplomatic Correspondence (S\u016dngmunw\u014fn \u627f\u6587\u9662), for the drafting of these \ndocuments.\n4\n W\nhile recent scholarship has used the notion of \u201cdiglossia\u201d as shorthand for Chos\u014fn\u2019s linguistic \nlandscape, this idea of two, complementary but distinct, linguistic spaces has its shortcom-ings. For instance, Ross King (1998, 36) identifies at least four broad written traditions coexist-ing in Korea by the nineteenth century. The interactions between different registers, scripts, and social spaces in Chos\u014fn Korea suggest the existence of a sociologically complex linguistic space that needs to be further explored. Boudewijn Walraven (2011, 43\u201345, 47\u201352) has at-tempted to study these phenomena through shaman songs and their relationship to dis-courses of nation in late Chos\u014fn Korea.

Korean court officials on envoy missions recorded travel diaries in classical Chinese, submitted memori-als to the Ming throne in elegant prose, and exchanged Tang-style poetry with their Chinese counterparts. For them, written exchanges reinforced the notion of a civilized world, a literary and textual universe bound by a common writing system. Whereas the Ming usually employed document translators to convert the letters presented by foreign magnates into written Chinese, Korea\u2019s use of literary Chinese absolved the Ming court of this task.17 A common expression used to describe imperial rule, and Korea\u2019s inclusion in this vision of empire, was \u201cwriting in the same script; carts with the same axle widths\u201d \u66f8\u540c\u6587 \u8eca\u540c\n\u8ecc: the unification of culture that paralleled the (apparent) union of political institutions.18 Writing and culture were thus inseparable and mutually em-bedded, encapsulated in the concept of mun/wen \u6587.\nIn a preface to accompany a poem written for envoys from the Kory\u014f (\u9ad8\u9e97, \n918\u20131392), the dynasty that preceded the Chos\u014fn in Korea, Song Lian \u5b8b\u6fc2 \n(1310\u20131381), an adviser to the first Ming emperor, elaborated a vision of empire that saw the Ming\u2019s civilizing power extending to foreign states and people. He saw Korea as a civilized place, where the \u201clegacies of the former kings\u201d were maintained. Korea\u2019s attention to ritual placed it in a league apart from the  \u201crulers of other countries,\u201d who were \u201cattached to barbarian ways\u201d and \u201cslight-ed ritual and righteousness.\u201d For Song, it was \u201conly appropriate that we [the Ming] see them [the Koreans] as among the \u2018Chinese\u2019\u201d and not \u201cin the same cate\n g\nory as \u2018foreign countries.\u2019\u201d Korea\u2019s acceptance of ritual principles and its \nlite\n r\nary accomplishments testified both to Korea\u2019s \u201ccivilized\u201d status and to the  \n16 Ch\u014fng Taham (2009, 271) has observed that the connection between spoken Chinese and \nthe invention of the Korean alphabet has been largely overlooked in recent scholarship. \n17\n Y\ne 1991, 84\u201385.\n18\n F\nor examples of this and similar expressions, see CWS Sejong 4:27b [1418.07.27/2], 64:1b \n[1434.04.02/5], 103:19b [1444.02.20/1]; Kw\u014fn K\u016dn, Yangch\u2019onjip \u967d\u6751\u96c6, vol. 1, in Han\u2019guk \nmunjip ch\u2019onggan \u97d3\u570b\u6587\u96c6\u53e2\u520a (hereafter HMC ), 7:15c.\nThis is a digital offprint for restricted use only | \u00a9 2014  Koninklijke Brill  NV\n63 The Politics Of Language In Early Chos\u014fn Korea\neffective  ness of the Ming\u2019s civilizing power.

Was the Korean mastery of written language and ritual enough to make the differences in language irrel-evant in imperial eyes?19\nLiterary exaltations of written culture, such as Song\u2019s, obscure the integral \nroles played by various specialists of spoken language in Korea\u2019s diplomacy with the Ming. Interpreters were, in fact, essential to the conduct of diplomacy. Understanding their role does much to illuminate the politics of language in Chos\u014fn Korea. Although this chapter will focus on the early Chos\u014fn-Ming pe-riod (1392\u20131550s), understanding the linguistic and political context preceding the Kory\u014f dynasty\u2019s engagement with the Mongol-Yuan Empire (\u8499\u5143 1209\u2013\n1368) in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries is critical. Throughout Kory\u014f\u2019s engagement with the Mongol-Yuan, war, diplomacy, and finally political inte-gration motivated the Kory\u014f court to control linguistic knowledge and pro-duced opportunities for linguistic specialists employed by the state to use their knowledge for their own, private ends. Though a polyglot Kory\u014f elite emerged in this period, the dynastic transitions of the fourteenth century reoriented the \nrelationship between diplomacy and linguistic knowledge. The early Chos\u014fn court no longer had ready access to speakers of Chinese and turned its efforts to the systematization of linguistic knowledge. New language manuals were developed after the invention of the Korean alphabet, which was itself deriva-tive of linguistic technologies and practices of cosmopolitan empire. These projects of linguistic systematization were both responses to the challenge of maintaining what had once been tacit linguistic knowledge and consumma-tions of Korea\u2019s prior integration into the Mongol imperium. In diplomatic \nspace, however, language meant more than communicating effectively or ac-curately and became fundamental to a host of other processes: sociability, rit-ual propriety, and political power. The possessors of this knowledge during the early Chos\u014fn period, court-based interpreters, had to navigate between rather contradictory forces: good interpreters were as indispensable as they were scarce, as pivotal as they were marginal, and as integral to the process of diplo-macy as they were suppressed from its records.\n19 Song Lian, Wenxianji \u6587\u61b2\u96c6 9:42b\u201344a, in Siku quanshu \u56db\u5eab\u5168\u66f8; see also Chang \nTong\u2019ik 1997, 379\u201380. \nThis is a digital offprint for restricted use only | \u00a9 2014  Koninklijke Brill  NV\n64 Wang\nAnxieties of Language: Korea and Empire\nKory\u014f\u2019s integration into the Mongol Empire in the late thirteenth and four-\nteenth centuries exposed a broad swath of Kory\u014f society to a multilingual world where both elite and non-elite alike could have learned Mongolian and Chinese for trade, politics, and prestige.

The wane of Mongol power in East Asia, however, dramatically shifted the linguistic landscape. When the Ming dynasty arose in China, King Kongmin \u606d\u610d\u738b (r. 1354\u20131374) had already sev-\nered many of the links that Kory\u014f had with the Yuan, markedly transforming Korea\u2019s place in East Asia. Kory\u014f-Ming relations did not feature the kinds of linkages that characterized late Kory\u014f-Yuan interaction.20 Whereas many from Kory\u014f once traveled frequently between their homeland and the imperial cen-ter, early Ming restrictions on maritime trade and the strict enforcement of the tribute system limited opportunities for contact, which occurred regularly only within the limited scope of envoy missions and border markets. Once open to Kory\u014f literati, imperial civil service examinations were now prohibited to them. Attempts to send sons of Kory\u014f elites to study in the Ming capital were rebuffed by the first emperor, Ming Taizu \u660e\u592a\u7956 (r. 1368\u20131398).21 Al-\nthough a Korean community in Liaoyang persisted through the fourteenth century, their intermediary position came to be perceived as a threat to this new, very different regional order.22 \nThe experience of the Korean Confucian scholar Yi Saek \u674e\u7a61 (1328\u20131396), \nwho lived through these transitions, is illustrative. Although hardly a typical representative of a career bureaucrat, he did exemplify the possibilities for travel and exchange during the last years of Mongol-Yuan hegemony. Yi Saek had passed the highest-level civil service examinations at both the Kory\u014f court and the Yuan court and served in the Yuan Hanlin Academy. He eventually re-turned to Korea and served in its bureaucracy, becoming one of the most prominent literary, intellectual, and political figures of his age.23 When Yi re-turned to China for the first time in decades in 1389 as a Kory\u014f envoy to the Ming, he had the following encounter with the Ming emperor:\n20 F or Ming and late Kory\u014f relations, see Robinson 2009, 274\u2013284; Ye 1991.\n21\n During \nthe entire Ming period, only two cohorts of Korean literati were allowed to travel \nto Ming China to participate in the civil service examinations, both early in the Hongwu reign.

The emperor laughed and said, \u201cYour Chinese is just like that of [the Mongol] Na\u03b3a\u010du!\u201d24 \nYi Saek\u2019s subsequent attempts to excuse his verbal fumbling only underscored the existence of barriers to communication. Even though Yi had once served as an official in China and been able to make himself understood in fluent spoken Chinese, that had been three decades ago. More importantly, the Ming em-peror\u2019s difficulty with Yi\u2019s speech is possible evidence of broader, regional dif-ferences and historical shifts in spoken language. Whereas Yi had launched his official career in the northern Yuan court in Beijing, he was now in the south-ern early Ming court based in Nanjing.25\nIn Korea, a long period of political instability culminated in the founding of \nthe Chos\u014fn dynasty in 1392. Through this transition, language became a point of controversy with the Ming. Ming Taizu\u2019s preexisting reservations regarding Kory\u014f, coupled with his wariness of overpowerful generals in his own court, made him cautious toward the new regime, whose leader Yi S\u014fnggye \u674e\u6210\u6842 \n(T\u2019aejo \u592a\u7956, r. 1392\u20131398) had come to power through a military coup d\u2019\u00e9tat.26 \nA series of diplomatic missives from the Chos\u014fn court from 1394 to 1397 in-curred the ire of the Ming emperor for allegedly containing inappropriate lan-guage: insulting puns and suggestive innuendos.27 To deflect accusations of intentional l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9, the Chos\u014fn court sent several missives that blamed the incompetence of their scribes and scholars.

How dare we, on purpose, mock and insult?\u201d28 Alleged ignorance of both classical texts and the Chinese language came to be Chos\u014fn\u2019s defense.\nAmong the envoys sent by the Chos\u014fn court to resolve the affair, one, Kw\u014fn \nK\u016dn \u6b0a\u8fd1 (1352\u20131409), managed to impress the Ming emperor with his im-\npromptu poetic compositions and, to a limited extent, restored the emperor\u2019s esteem for Korea. Kw\u014fn returned to Korea with an oral edict \u53e3\u8aed from the \nemperor:29\nFor a small country to serve a large country, everything should be done straight and proper. Where does the sun rise and set? Under heaven there is just one sun, and you can\u2019t hide things from the sun. When those envoys come again from that place of yours, if they understand Chinese, let them come; if they don\u2019t have a clue about Chinese, don\u2019t let them come. That time we were talking about the marriage of my grandkids to the king of Chos\u014fn\u2019s grandkids, you sent a prime minister who knew Chinese, and I agreed to it right then and there, and let him go home.

If Korea\u2019s place in the civilized order, in both a political and an ideological sense, rested on the ability to communicate ef-fectively with the imperial center, the emperor\u2019s edict directly rejected Korea\u2019s claim of cultural and political legitimacy. For Korea, which had enjoyed the prestige of being a country that, in Song Lian\u2019s words, should not be seen as \u201cforeign\u201d but virtually \u201cChinese,\u201d the Ming founder\u2019s statement challenged the notion that differences in language could be overlooked in guaranteeing Korea a special place in the imperial order.\nPartly as a response to the escalation of tensions with the Ming, the Chos\u014fn \ncourt rehabilitated a once-disgraced courtier, S\u014fl Changsu \u5070\u9577\u58fd (1341\u20131399), \nin 1394.32 In accordance with Ming Taizu\u2019s demand that future Korean envoys speak Chinese, S\u014fl led many of the subsequent envoy missions to the Ming from 1396 until his death, and he spoke with the Ming emperor directly, con-versing in Chinese.33 S\u014fl\u2019s language skills had much to do with his personal background. Not natives of Korea but \u00e9migr\u00e9s from Yuan China, his family had been classified as semuren \u8272\u76ee\u4eba during the Yuan and belonged to an illustri-\nous Uighur lineage, the Gaochang Xie \u9ad8\u660c\u5070, whose members served as ca-\nreer bureaucrats for the Yuan state.34 A branch of the family eventually settled in Kory\u014f and became noted for their fluency in both Mongolian and Chinese.35 Along with Yi Saek, who had died in 1396, they were among the last representa-tives of a generation of men whose careers had been made in official service both in Korea and at the imperial court.\n31 F or Ming Taizu, the directness of oral speech may have been preferable to literary prose, \nwhich he thought had a tendency to obfuscate.

Upon his return from exile in 1394, S\u014fl presented a plan for establishing examinations for the training of pro-fessional interpreters. Besides specific curricula, he also proposed ways to ad-dress a problem of general reluctance among potential students, who \u201crarely come of their own accord.\u201d36 The concern over enrollment suggests that the Chos\u014fn institution was interested not only in selecting available talent through examination but also in systematically cultivating it.

But more importantly, the ability to operate within the linguistic and cultural sphere of the Ming court was exactly what was sup-posed to separate Korea from \u201cother foreign countries\u201d and thus made its maintenance absolutely critical. Yu Sun continued: \nIf we send our students to [the Ming] for study and, returning with their understanding of clerical writing and Chinese language, they can be transferred to instruct [others], then those who comprehend Chinese sounds and understand clerical writing will increase in number. The king\u2019s intentions are quite sound. But from the previous dynasty until now, we have not sent students for generations. During the reign of King Sejong, we requested permission, citing precedents from past dynasties, but until the very end, the Central Court would not permit it.39 \nEmbedded in this account is both a sense of a cultural crisis and an epistemic dilemma.

This case of misinterpretation illustrates the connection between technical knowledge, linguistic mastery, and the problem of authority. The \u201cproper\u201d meaning of such words was not self-evident, despite shared knowledge of the classical language.40\nDespite numerous initiatives meant to encourage the learning of these spe-\ncialist skills, the number of individuals of able talent fell short of demand. Thus, anxiety over this knowledge may have been compounded by the reliance on only a handful of key figures for its maintenance.41 In the early sixteenth century, the court sometimes debated the selection of qualified interpreters to send with envoys to Beijing; it worried that should too many accompany an important mission, none would remain at court by the king.42 The ideal reso-lution to the problem would have been to send students to China to study, but such proposals had been rebuffed repeatedly by the Ming. Officials continued to lament in 1539 that \u201cour country\u2019s civilization, rituals, and institutions are no different from those of China; only the sounds of the language are not similar\u201d; and \u201cever since the beginning of the dynasty, [we have not been able to] send students to study [in China].\u201d43 Such statements echoed expressions of woe spoken by their predecessors over a century before, in 1433: \u201chenceforth our hopes of sending students to China are shattered; it remains that spoken Chi-nese is of utmost importance and is indeed a cause for worry.\u201d44 In each of these instances, the encouragement of language learning in the Office of Inter-preters became the second-best option, an imperfect alternative to directly ac-cessing imperial centers of learning. \nThe maintenance and use of linguistic knowledge presented significant \nchallenges for the founders of the Chos\u014fn dynasty.

By the mid-sixteenth century, some of their expressions and grammatical forms were already seen to be obsolete.60 Although these texts were held to be authoritative through the nineteenth century, their contents had to be repeatedly revised throughout the duration of their use. Efforts to update linguistic knowledge motivated new publications, such as one annotated text based on the libretto of a contempo-rary Chinese didactic drama piece. The compilers of this text recognized not only the divergence of contemporary Chinese phonology from classical norms but also how even nonliterary language changed over time:\nIn the Comprehensive Explanation, the pronunciation of the characters \noften followed what was \u201cvulgar,\u201d and now the speech common in China has changed greatly from the \u201cvulgar\u201d pronunciation of the Comprehen-\nsive Explanation.

By providing classical readings alongside contemporary Chinese pronuncia-tion, these texts not only served as a repertoire of linguistic models for the training of interpreters but also preserved the authority of classical phonology. The codification and standardization of linguistic knowledge shifted the bur-den of preservation to the printed text; but for all its careful annotation and explication, it still struggled with the problem of linguistic change.62\nOne should be reminded, however, that for interpreters who had to  \ncross gulfs of linguistic difference, effective mediation meant more than \n59 T \u2019ongmun\u02bcgwan chi 2006, 53\u201360; Yang 2007. \n60\n See n. 54.\n61\n Oryun ch\n\u014f\nnbi \n\u014f\nnhae (1721) 2005, 10.\n62\n The \nlinguistic relationships between classical phonology, contemporary Chinese speech, \nand a variety of Korean usages were complex.

For example, the posthu-mous biography of the scholar-official Yi S\u014fkhy\u014fng \uf9e1\u77f3\u4ea8 (1415\u20131477) illus-\ntrates the inferior position of linguistic knowledge vis-\u00e0-vis classical learning:\n63 One Chos\u014fn interpreter was almost punished after being accused of \u201cshowing writing in \nthe vernacular\u201d to a Ming envoy.

Describing the youth as a \u201cgentleman who loved antiquity, widely learned and elegant,\u201d Kang was sure that he would appreciate the historical sites and cultural sig-nificance of the Ming capital. In the same document, Kang denigrated the court interpreters: \nIn this world there are \u201ctongue-people\u201d who in the morning are in Han-yang [the Chos\u014fn capital] and at night are in Yanjing [Beijing] and who die old as seasoned travelers.

In a funerary inscription praising a local official of a district frequented by envoy missions to the Ming for his upright-ness and incorruptibility, we find his refusal to entertain \u201cthe tongue-people,\u201d who often attempted to visit him bearing gifts, listed as evidence of his recti-tude.73\nThough interpreters were disparaged, the service of talented interpreters \nwas still greatly valued by the Chos\u014fn monarchy. King Chungjong \u4e2d\u5b97 (r. \n1506\u20131544), for example, maintained his confidence in Ch\u2019oe despite requests for his dismissal.74 Ch\u2019oe\u2019s ability to understand sensitive documents from the Ming that contained colloquial diction and nonliterary usage probably also re-inforced Chungjong\u2019s faith in him.75 Well respected by some and reviled by others, this controversial figure testifies to the complex ways in which language had become politicized in Chos\u014fn Korea\u2019s social space.76\nGiven the importance of linguistic knowledge for diplomacy, the low social \nesteem accorded to individuals who possessed it appears counterintuitive. Certainly, the debasement of linguistic skill in Chos\u014fn times may be attributed to existing social prejudices. Since its inauguration, it was difficult for the Of-fice of Interpreters to attract qualified students, and highborn sons of elite families refused to participate.77 Such perceptions may have been socially self-fulfilling: the reluctance of the aristocracy to participate in these careers reinforced their marginality. On further examination, however, the construc-tion of social distance may in fact reveal intricate ties between language and power. Inverting the customary denigration of interpreters and linguistic \non the social backgrounds of these interpreters, see Song Ch\u2019unyong 1998, 109\u2013110, 171\u2013172, \n214\u2013215. \n73\n Ki \nTaes\u016dng, Kobongjip \u9ad8\u5cef\u96c6, vol. 3, in HMC  40:111a\u2013111b.

The very emphasis on social distance between aristocratic court officials and lower-born interpreters who had mastered an ostensibly in-ferior but related set of skills masked the actual proximity of their respective knowledge areas.80\nThe Chos\u014fn court probably recognized both the potential of linguistic \nknowledge for social mobility and its capacity to usurp political access, and sought to control it. David Laitin\u2019s work on African linguistic repertoires makes use of the concept of \u201celite closure,\u201d which describes a situation in which exclu-sive access to language functioned as a barrier to social mobility.81 Applying this concept of elite closure to the politics of language in early Chos\u014fn, the social debasement of linguistic knowledge in relation to the mastery of classi-cal Chinese becomes understandable. The existence of professional interpret-ers, especially those who also displayed literary skills or classical knowledge, could have threatened the existing social order. Without the enforcement of social boundaries in the court, the monopoly over classical learning and liter-ary erudition exercised by the elite and by the court, and even political access to Ming China, could be usurped and the avenues of access that these skills provided easily acquired by social inferiors who secured knowledge of the spo-ken language.\nInterpreters were discriminated against not only by their colleagues at the \nChos\u014fn court but also by Ming envoys.82 While Ming envoys and their Chos\u014fn counterparts exchanged poems of friendship that fostered a sense of social \n78 \u014e and Lee (1 7th cent.) 1989, 38, 92.\n79\n \u014e and Lee (1\n7th cent.) 1989, 152\u2013153, 213\u2013214.\n80\n \u014e \nSukkw\u014fn, for example, was a secondary son of an aristocrat.

An excerpt from one such poem reads as follows: \u201cwho says that speech and language are base things, / not as deep as the intentions of a person\u2019s heart? / We all depended on your Lord-ship\u2019s three-inch tongue / to understand one another\u2019s heart.\u201d83 Though lauda-tory, the poem\u2019s praise rests upon assumptions of low social esteem accorded to the masters of spoken language. The tongue was valuable only insofar as it served as a tool for building intellectual and emotional rapport.\nThe construction of social distance between the interpreters and the official \nenvoys of the Chos\u014fn and Ming courts maintained a parallel hierarchy of knowledge between classical learning and technical expertise. Interpreters were left on the margins of a diplomacy that emphasized literary commensu-rability and elevated the written over the spoken, the literary over the techni-cal. At times, even the aptitude of interpreters was scrutinized and doubted. In describing their preference for written communication over oral transmission, diplomats cited the \u201cunreliability\u201d of these interpreters. The 1460 emissary Zhang Ning \u5f35\u5be7 (1426\u20131496) did exactly that when he called for the use of \nbrush and paper and dismissed the Korean interpreters, preferring to engage in written conversation with the Korean king.84 After the successful conclusion of his mission, Zhang returned with an anthology that collected the poetry he wrote with his Chos\u014fn hosts.85 In the end, it was the literary production\u2014the poems written in classical Chinese\u2014that was the monumental accomplish-ment of Zhang Ning\u2019s embassy. \nZhang Ning was not alone. When the 1537 Ming envoy Gong Yongqing \u9f94\u7528\n\u537f (1500\u20131563) found himself at odds on many issues with Chos\u014fn\u2019s ritual of-ficials, he, \u201cconcerned that the interpreters did not transmit words honestly,\u201d chose to rely on written communication instead.86 Gong also left extensive records of his mission to Korea and saw his own writing as helpful to future Ming emissaries.

And so, one [should] treat them not as \u2018barbarian\u2019 but as Chinese.\u201d87 Problems of spoken language remained secondary to the concerns of ritual propriety, and spoken language appeared only tangential to the problem of cultural commensurability. In both the Zhang Ning and Gong Yongqing cases, spoken language had failed to achieve its end; the burden of discourse and negotiation fell on the written word. Writing \u6587, emblematic of Korea\u2019s status as a civilized country, had tri-\numphed over the spoken, which was unreliable and uncertain. \nIn a sense, the construction of social distance between literati envoys and \ninterpreters was a by-product of a desire to maintain social parity between Chos\u014fn officials and Ming ambassadors. Despite their shared knowledge of lit-erary Chinese and commonalities in their educational and social backgrounds, the distance created by spoken language was left to be bridged by a Korean interpreter. This mechanism of differentiation produced a paradox of histori-cal representation in which the interpreters, though ubiquitous in diplomatic encounters and vital to effective communication, appear only tangentially in historical sources such as envoy travel writing or are mentioned only briefly as messengers and errand runners. \nDespite the privileged status of the written language in this discourse, spo-\nken language and its interpreters bore the brunt of facilitating daily interac-tions between the Ming ambassador and his counterparts. In his journal, Yu H\u016dich\u2019un wrote of his encounter with a Ming envoy:\nThe [Ming] assistant emissary asked the interpreter, \u201cYour state is a coun-\ntry of manifest civility.

Some may sell the myriad volumes collected \nby their family, and even the writings of their ancestors get discarded. Even if you do not have a complete edition, if I can see a few pieces, that would suffice. Please tell this to the welcoming emissary.\u201d \nI told the interpreter to answer this way: \u201cOur country receives the civi-\nlizing transformations of the Central State, and generation after genera-tion there are those who put their efforts in study. But we do not know whether what they learned is refined or flawed. Nevertheless, there often are written works. If you want to take a look, we will seek them out and present them to you.\u201d \nThe assistant emissary then answered, \u201cWith so many pieces of writing, \nthere must be something worth reading. I wanted to know the splendor of human talent and the attainment of learning, and now that I have received your reply, I am greatly thankful. I just want to take one look.\u201d88 \nThe above oral exchange could not have been accomplished without the inter-vention of an interpreter. Presented as a conversation between Yu and the Ming emissary, the interpreter seems to serve no other purpose than to trans-mit faithfully the intention of the two courtiers. The illusion of seamlessness may have been a function of linguistic fidelity; but the nuances of presentation and affect\u2013\u2013flattery, humility, and appreciation\u2013\u2013appear on the page as trans-parent sentiments. The curious but courteous guest and the humble, hospita-ble host emerge not through direct conversation but via the mediating, but also conspicuously silent, voice of their actual interlocutor, the nameless inter-preter. We cannot know, at least in this case, how much the interpreter\u2019s me-diation in fact shaped the emotive contours and ritualized affects that characterize this exchange. The existence of a linguistic gulf may very well have provided an opportunity to reassert and reinvent diplomatic convention: its discourse and politesse were constructed through the mediating potential of language in translation.\nThe above conversation also illustrates the opportunity for self-representa-\ntion that linguistic distance provided. By mediating exchanges, the process of interpretation staved off the pressures of immediacy, allowing both parties time and space to develop a carefully calculated response.

He said that in the Eastern Country [i.e., Korea], there were none who could compare with him. When he reached Yangch\u2019aek Post, he was eating gingko nuts and wrote the first line of a couplet, \u201cinside the shell of the silver apricot [gingko] is hidden a green jade\u201d \u9280\u674f\u7532\u4e2d\u85cf\u78a7\u7389, and asked the interpreter P\u2019yo \nCh\u2019\u014fngno \u8868\u5ef7\u8001 to ask the welcoming emissary to come over and match \nthe verse. \nA situation in which an interpreter effected social interaction between his so-cial superiors was not itself remarkable. The record, however, continues:\n[But instead,] he [P\u2019yo] went over and wrote the following: \u201cunder the skin of a stone durian [i.e., pomegranate] are spotted cinnabar pebbles\u201d \u77f3\u69b4\u76ae\u4e0b\u9ede\u6731\u7802. The Chinese envoy was greatly astonished and praised it immensely, saying, \u201cIf even the interpreters are [as talented as] such,  I must not look down on the welcoming emissaries!\u201d89\nWhile literary exchange remained the purview of the Ming envoy and high of-ficials in the Chos\u014fn court, the very functioning of their literary sociability re-quired the mediation of these interpreters. P\u2019yo had been called over by the Chinese emissary to communicate to his Korean counterparts. Though the Ming envoy had rather low expectations of Korean literary accomplishment, in this and similar narratives the Ming envoy recants his original calumny once his hosts demonstrate their abilities. In such situations, literary virtuosity from an erudite interpreter could go far in impressing his Chinese guest through the demonstration of not only his own talent but also the overall refinement of the country he represented.\nIn the context of diplomacy, the insistence on constant decorum required \nattention to ritual detail by all participants, including the interpreters, who alone were charged with representing Chos\u014fn through speech. In his record of a conversation with King Chungjong, the envoy Gong Yongqing reveals how an interpreter\u2019s minute interactions with a Ming envoy played a role in maintain-ing Chos\u014fn\u2019s image as a \u201ccivilized\u201d country:\n89 T \u2019ongmun\u2019gwan chi 2006, 7:12b\u201313a.

But, today, now that we have met you two Celestial Envoys [Gong Yongq-ing and his deputy], our joy and exuberance are overwhelming. It is as the Classic of Poetry says, \u2018Now that I have met the noble man, my heart is indeed glad\u2019 \u65e2\u898b\u541b\u5b50 \u6211\u5fc3\u5247\u559c.\u201d\nWe [Gong and his assistant] answered back, \u201cWe live in China, uphold-\ning the upright command of the Son of Heaven, and have brought his edicts to your country. And we also have known that your country has been able to observe ritual and righteousness. We have also heard that the king lives frugally, and today we have seen these [things]. They are all truly not contrary to what we have heard.\u201d\nThe king said again, \u201c[You,] the two Celestial Envoys, are attendants \nand important officials of the Son of Heaven. If it had not been for this great cause for celebration [i.e., the emperor had just appointed a crown prince], how else could I have seen your faces?\u201d90\nThe intertwining of politesse and elegant language produced an effect of for-malism, a conversation predetermined in semantic content, rhetorical fash-ioning, and gesture. The language drew upon classical allusions and reiterated the tropes conventional in envoy poetry of this time. Because Gong\u2019s record is entirely in classical Chinese, we cannot be certain whether the words recorded were verbatim or a \u201cliterary summary\u201d of actual speech. Though citing the Classic of Poetry could probably be achieved by any classically educated Kore-an at the time, the interpreter had to do so while rendering the language in a way immediately comprehensible to the Ming envoy. In this way, the ritual function of the interpreter was as much the performance of cultural literacy as the transmission of the king\u2019s sentiment. In turn, the ritual moment thus cre-ated from the utterance of these words concealed linguistic difference. A medi-ated exchange was performed as the expression of authentic sentiment and, through Gong\u2019s intervention as a writer documenting the affair, was inscribed in text as an idealized moment. In addition, the very construction of this ritual moment celebrated in Gong\u2019s envoy account depended not only on the careful use of language but also on the Chos\u014fn state\u2019s orchestration of numerous per-sonnel and the employment of its institutional knowledge. All matters of the Ming envoy\u2019s reception had been prepared well in advance of his arrival, in-cluding the actual words to be spoken on such occasions.91\n90 Gong Yongqing, Shi Chaoxian lu, 1:39a\u201339b.\n91\n A \nmemorial describing this process is preserved in O K\u014fn, T\u014fkkyes\u014fnsaeng munjip \u5fb7\u6eaa\n\u5148\u751f\u6587\u96c6, vol. 4, in HMC  38:126d\u2013127a.\nThis is a digital offprint for restricted use only | \u00a9 2014  Koninklijke Brill  NV\n86 Wang\nChos\u014fn\u2019s assiduous representation of itself as a civilized state went hand in \nhand with exaltations of the Ming\u2019s", "doc_id": "a214c809-4d8b-4cd8-ad71-4abc816f4ea7", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "ef4545e1399023d3644d42566af0b94e55595ca1829d3a06a46136061c3cf652", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 99505, "end": 102951}, "relationships": {"1": "63cb62f6-9679-41d0-a5d9-3bf517e944f0", "2": "c7c90371-a30e-4b81-9dcf-18b7d6be5b3d", "3": "821dd0b4-8d7f-49d1-a6fb-e8c065c75867"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "821dd0b4-8d7f-49d1-a6fb-e8c065c75867": {"__data__": {"text": "All matters of the Ming envoy\u2019s reception had been prepared well in advance of his arrival, in-cluding the actual words to be spoken on such occasions.91\n90 Gong Yongqing, Shi Chaoxian lu, 1:39a\u201339b.\n91\n A \nmemorial describing this process is preserved in O K\u014fn, T\u014fkkyes\u014fnsaeng munjip \u5fb7\u6eaa\n\u5148\u751f\u6587\u96c6, vol. 4, in HMC  38:126d\u2013127a.\nThis is a digital offprint for restricted use only | \u00a9 2014  Koninklijke Brill  NV\n86 Wang\nChos\u014fn\u2019s assiduous representation of itself as a civilized state went hand in \nhand with exaltations of the Ming\u2019s civilizing project. Likewise, Gong\u2019s praises \nof Chos\u014fn\u2019s cultural achievements also served as encomia of the Ming: \u201cit is because the teachings of the imperial Ming reach far that the cartwheel tracks and writing are unified with the mountains and rivers.\u201d These two rhetorical demands created a context in which it was to the advantage of both the Ming envoy and his Chos\u014fn hosts to produce a literary legacy of mutual commenda-tion. Like those of his predecessors, Gong\u2019s poems in praise of his Chos\u014fn hosts emphasized commonality in language and culture. Whatever differences there were between the Ming and the Chos\u014fn were resolved through shared cultural institutions. And so, Gong was \u201cever happy that literature and culture are re-splendent in the Eastern Vassal [i.e., Korea], [where] all those who wear caps and gowns are men who read books.\u201d Through these achievements, the classi-cal past was revived, and the spatial distance of Chos\u014fn Korea from ancient China became inconsequential through temporal conflation. Gong asked, \u201cWho says that this small place is far and obscure? I have already seen that their robes and caps follow ancient customs.\u201d And through the mastery of not just knowledge but the performance of culture, Korea became China\u2019s equal: \u201cThe rivers and streams [of Korea] do not fall short of China\u2019s greatness; its people have always been cultivated in air and bearing.\u201d In transforming Korea into a recipient of Ming \u201ccivilization\u201d and an exemplar of classical ideals, even the embodiment of linguistic difference\u2014interpreters, erstwhile inconvenient barriers to the communication of ritual order\u2013\u2013was transformed into an em-blem of commensurability (\u201cTheir interpreters are all selected from among the students and scholars\u201d), buttressing Ming claims to universal civilization and moral empire.92 \nIn his poetry, Gong asserted cultural commensurability over linguistic dif-\nference, largely ignoring the problems of spoken language. Both audience and participant in this ritual performance, the Ming envoy refracted experience into a model of ritual through a written account that eschewed the nitty-gritty, the mishaps, and the contentions in favor of an idealized representation. As a sign of incommensurability, linguistic difference became merely a slight in-convenience to the satisfactory communication of broader political concerns. It was, however, the act of interpretation that rendered the seam of linguistic distinction invisible.

Even as professional interpreters became indis-pensable to Korean diplomacy with the Ming, they remained marginal figures, both as social actors and as historical figures. On the one hand, facilitating so-cial interactions with Ming envoys and, on the other, subject to exclusion and social discrimination, interpreters in the early Chos\u014fn straddled several social spaces. The operating logics of each of these spaces did not cohere but rather undergirded a set of anxieties and contradictions in Chos\u014fn attitudes toward learning and knowledge, its own identity as a civilized state, and its relation-ship with Ming China. Language, as a site of symbolic contestation, was inter-meshed with the practice of diplomacy, in both the quotidian, routine exercise of political negotiation and the orchestrated performance of elaborate ritual. \nNevertheless, the picture that I have tried to paint is schematic at best and \nonly outlines some of the critical issues pertaining to the politics of language during this period. For one, the \u201cvernacular alphabet\u201d was not the only  technology of language that figured into questions of translation, cultural ex-change, and knowledge. I have not discussed a wide range of linguistic prac-tices and inscriptional conventions.93 Neither was diplomacy the only context in which language mattered.94 Nor were these issues exclusive to the four-teenth\u2013sixteenth centuries. In Korea, the question of linguistic divergence also came to be connected to the issue of Chos\u014fn cultural legitimacy after the rise of the Qing in the mid-seventeenth century, when \u201cbarbarian\u201d Manchu  conquerors replaced the Ming in China.95 An intellectual shift among eigh-teenth-century Neo-Confucian thinkers sought to reposition Korea, displacing China as center and rejecting Manchu claims to imperial legitimacy. The fall of \n93 Idu , hyangch\u2019al, and kugy\u014fl are among the other systems. See Buzo 1980.\n94\n Gender \nalso played a significant role in linguistic/inscriptional practice in Chos\u014fn society. \nSee Haboush 2002.\n95\n Haboush \n2005; Sun 2007. The Manchu invasions also present an interesting period of time \nfor studying the role of interpreters in diplomacy, and parallels can be drawn between the \nseventeenth century and the Mongol period. \nThis is a digital offprint for restricted use only | \u00a9 2014  Koninklijke Brill  NV\n88 Wang\ncivilization to \u201cbarbarians\u201d allowed the Korean ruling class to see itself as the \nlast bastion, if not a new fountainhead, of classical civilization.96 \nIntellectual rejection of the Qing did not, however, translate into political \nisolation.

Diplomacy remained a central concern. The idea that Chos\u014fn Korea was now Ming China\u2019s cultural and political heir may have actually exacerbat-ed anxieties over proper linguistic knowledge. Yu Hy\u014fngw\u014fn \u67f3\u99a8\u9060 (1622\u2013\n1673), a reform-minded scholar in official retirement, for example, called for the revival of King Sejong\u2019s linguistic projects and proposed reforms to revital-ize the study of spoken Chinese among civil officials. Even though Yu called for adopting \u201cChinese-style\u201d pronunciations over what had become standard Ko-rean ones, he encouraged the use of the Korean alphabet as a mediating device for comprehending classical texts.97\nIf we keep this context in mind, we can see that even the debate over the \npronunciation of a single Chinese character carried new significance. Hong Taeyong \u6d2a\u5927\u5bb9 (1731\u20131783), who traveled to Beijing with a Korean embassy, \nquestioned a Chinese scholar named Deng Shimin over his rhyming of \u201cpov-erty\u201d (pin \u8ca7) and \u201clute\u201d (qin \u7434) in their poetry exchange.98 Remarking that \nthese two characters belonged to two separate rhyme categories, he wrote:\nIs this perhaps a mistake? Our eastern country [i.e., Korea] has a different script for the vernacular. It has sound, but no meaning. There are fewer than two hundred characters, vowels and consonants are clearly differen-tiated, and all the myriad sounds can be expressed with them. Women and simple folk who do not know Chinese characters use this vernacular script and write in our local language. All letters and documents written in this script are readily comprehensible, often more so than those writ-ten in the \u201ctrue script\u201d [i.e., Chinese]. Though it lacks elegance, its clarity and usefulness are also a help in cultivating the people. We transcribe the sounds of all the characters in the classical writings in this script; there-fore, there are no deviant pronunciations for any of the characters \n96 Haboush 1 999.\n97\n P\nalais 1996, 639\u2013640.\n98\n N\note that while in Mandarin, the final consonants of these two characters would have \nmerged from -n and -m into -n by this period, Korean orthography and pronunciation \npreserved this distinction. Though the poem in question probably rhymed in eighteenth-\ncentury Chinese, as it does in modern Mandarin, it does not do so in Korean readings, where pin \u8ca7 is read pin, and qin \u7434 is read k\u016dm. Indeed, the two different final conso-\nnants place these two characters into different rhyme categories.\nThis is a digital offprint for restricted use only | \u00a9 2014  Koninklijke Brill  NV\n89 The Politics Of Language In Early Chos\u014fn Korea\ncontained in the classics throughout the country, and the pronunciations \ndo not change over time.99\nAccording to Hong, the use of the Korean alphabet allowed the Koreans to suc-cessfully preserve older pronunciations of Chinese characters, \u201ccorrect\u201d ac-cording to rhyme tables, whose rules the Chinese literatus had failed to observe.

For him, the \u201cvernacular script\u201d became a technology of transmission that provided an authoritative source of knowledge that was not only indepen-dent of but superior to contemporary Chinese practice. In contrast, Pak Che-ga \u6734\u9f4a\u5bb6 (1750\u20131805), in his Discussion of Northern Learning, saw the Korean use \nof \u201cvernacular explications\u201d and the \u201cbarrier of language\u201d to be why Koreans, despite their dedication to literary and classical learning, supposedly fell short of the Chinese. Noting that in China even \u201cwomen and children who are illiter-ate\u201d speak in literary flourishes because of the similarity of spoken Chinese to the literary language, Pak even proposed that the whole country of Korea should \u201cdiscard their native speech\u201d so that they may \u201cfinally be rid of the label \u2018barbarian.\u2019\u201d100 Though contemporaries, Pak\u2019s and Hong\u2019s opinions on the rela-tionships between Korean, spoken Chinese, and classical learning could not have been more different.\nThrough the late Chos\u014fn period, the Office of Interpreters continued to play \nimportant roles in diplomacy. It was responsible for training not only special-ists in Chinese language but, up until the end of the dynasty, experts in Japa-nese, Manchu, and Mongolian. In the late nineteenth century, after Chos\u014fn Korea had to grapple with a new diplomatic order in East Asia, the Office of Interpreters was abolished in the Kabo reforms of 1894.101 Subsequently, many of its former members came to play pivotal roles in late Chos\u014fn Korea\u2019s efforts at \u201cmodernization.\u201d102 Connecting the Office of Interpreters to the \u201cmoderniz-ing\u201d reforms of the nineteenth century is less an attempt to somehow locate the seeds of the modern in earlier institutions than to reframe our understand-ings of these historical trajectories. The elevation of the vernacular script to official status in 1894 was not a logical or inevitable development from the \n99 Hong Taeyong, \u201cLetter to Wenxuan,\u201d in Tamh\u014fns\u014foejip \u6e5b\u8ed2\u66f8\u5916\u96c6, vol. 2, in HMC \n248:127c; translated by Marion Eggert in Haboush 2009, 209.\n100\n P\nak Che-ga and Kuksa p\u2019y \u014f\nnch\u2019an wiw \u014f\nnhoe, Ch\n\u014f\nngyujip: Pu Pukhag\n\u016d\ni \u8c9e\u8564\u96c6 : \u9644\u5317\u5b78\n\u8b70, 412.\n101\n Song Kijung 2001, 9\u201310.\n10\n2\n Hw\nang 2004, 106\u2013160.\nThis is a digital offprint for restricted use only | \u00a9 2014  Koninklijke Brill  NV\n90 Wang\nscript\u2019s earlier invention but was shaped by the particular political pressures, \nintellectual shifts, and changing cultural attitudes that characterized the last decades of the Chos\u014fn dynasty.103 On the other hand, neither does the ver-nacular script owe its preferment simply to the convulsions of the nineteenth century.

Although an awareness of Korea\u2019s distinct language figured in the discourse of both King Sejong\u2019s court and nineteenth-century language reformers, revealing shared concerns about the commensurability of speech and text, the moment of the alphabet\u2019s prom-ulgation in 1446 and its eventual apotheosis after 1894 were informed by rather different political and ideological motivations. And between them lay a com-plex negotiation between language, politics, and culture that I have attempted to reveal. Beyond the practice of diplomacy, language and script were central to politics and society in Chos\u014fn Korea, and these connections deserve closer study.\nReferences\nAlston, Dane 2008. \u201cEmperor and Emissary: The Hongwu Emperor, Kw\u014fn K\u016dn, and the \nPoetry of Late Fourteenth Century Diplomacy,\u201d Korean Studies 32: 101\u2013147.\nAn Py\u014fngh\u016di \u5b89\u79c9\u79a7 2001. \u201cKy\u014fngguk Taej\u014fn \u016di \u2018Py\u014fngyong Mun\u2019gwan\u2019 kwa Ch\u2019oe Sejin \n\u016di sinbun\u201d \u7d93\u570b\u5927\u5178\uc758 \u2018\u7add\u7528\u6587\u5b98\u2019 \uacfc \u5d14\u4e16\u93ad\uc758 \u8eab\u5206 [Dual employment of civil \nofficials in the National Code and the status of Ch\u2019oe Sejin], Kug\u014fhak 38: 329\u2013347.\nBrose, Michael C. 2005. \u201cUyghur Technologists of Writing and Literacy in Mongol China,\u201d \nT\u2019oung Pao, 2nd ser., 91, 4/5 (January 1): 396\u2013435.\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 2007.

To sustain themselves, e mpires \nboth coerce and persuade . Tools  of persu asion, however, were seldom the monopoly of those who \nsought to dominate, for they could also be  contested and appropriated by those who sought to \nresist. This dissertation on Chos\u014fn Korea \u2019s (1392 \u20131910) interactions with Ming China (1368 \u20131644) \noffers a cultural history of interstate orders and diplomatic institutions in early modern Korea and \nEast Asia. I illustrate how Chos\u014fn appropriated the persuasive technologies that sustained Ming \nempire as a political imaginary to contest Ming imperial claims and ultima tely reshape imperial \nideology.  \nChos\u014fn -Ming relations have long been described in terms of \u201ctributary relations.\u201d This \nparadigm, as conceived by John K. Fairbank and others, understands these relations as the logical \nconsequence of a shared Confucian ideology and illustrative of Korea \u2019s historical status as China \u2019s \nmodel tributary. These approaches privilege a metropole -centered vantage and have failed to \naccount for Korean agency. They treat Korean envoy missions, ritual performances, and literary \nproduction as scripted gestures that can only reflect stable ideology. Meanwhile, they miss how these \nacts were contesting and tr ansforming ideology in the process. I argue that  the Chos\u014fn court in fact \nexercised enormous agency through these ritualized practices. The discourses of the Ming as moral \nempire and Korea as a loyal vassal, long held to be emblematic features of the tributary system, were \na large part reified products of Chos\u014fn diplomatic strategy. They did not reflect a pre -existing \n \n political order, but constituted its very substance. They were part of the \u201cknowledge of empire\u201d \nproduced by the Chos\u014fn court for comprehending the Ming and its institutions and influencing  \nimperial ideology. Facilitated by institutional practices at the Chos\u014fn court, this \u201cknowledge of \nempire\u201d allowed Chos\u014fn to manage successfully asymmetrical", "doc_id": "38d11754-ee0c-43f1-a2e3-13df5e8b4cb5", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "691873105723611b8e9755c89eecb499ab7430023dd0d4d8603f99b7f115b4db", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3476}, "relationships": {"1": "f47394fe-94c7-4ac0-a316-a92b37a55a86", "3": "99868012-6c07-41fd-a53d-3f932ad7a1cd"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "99868012-6c07-41fd-a53d-3f932ad7a1cd": {"__data__": {"text": "process.

Facilitated by institutional practices at the Chos\u014fn court, this \u201cknowledge of \nempire\u201d allowed Chos\u014fn to manage successfully asymmetrical relations with the Ming and co -\nconstruct Ming empire in the process.  \nChapter 1 examines Korean dip lomatic epistles to show how the Korean court used its \nknowledge of historical precedents, ritual logics, and literary tropes of empire -making to contest \nsymbols of imperial legitimacy. Chapter 2 discusses how Korean emissaries appealed to ideals of \nmoral empire and reified particular understandings of Korea \u2019s relationship with the Ming to achieve \ntheir diplomatic ends. Chapter 3 treats Korean envoy missions as a conduit for information on  Ming \ninstitutions and politics. As a result, the Chos\u014fn was able to construct a dynamic of knowledge \nasymmetry where it knew more about the Ming than vice -versa. Once empire was constructed, its \nsymbols and institutions were subject to appropriation. Chap ter 4 looks at one such example, where \na Korean prince manipulated diplomacy with the Ming to usurp the Chos\u014fn throne. Chapter 5 \nshows how the practices of envoy poetry associated with the Brilliant Flowers Anthology (Hwanghwajip ) \nbecame a site where compe ting narratives of how Chos\u014fn \u2019s relationship to empire, civilization, and \nthe imperial past could stand together. Chapter 6 continues the discussion of envoy poetry by \nturning to its associated spatial practices. Chos\u014fn court poets invested the city of P \u2019y\u014fngyang with \nsymbolic resonances that asserted Korean cultural parity with China, legitimized Korean autonomy \nand denounced historical imperial claims on Korean territory, all without infringing on Ming claims \nof universal empire.\n \n i  Co-constructing Empire in  Early Chos\u014fn Korea  \nKnowledge Production and the Culture of

of one alone. I owe my gratitude t o everyone \nwho has  accompanied me during its creation . First, I must thank the late JaHyun Kim Haboush \nunder whose supervision  I began  my graduate studies. I t was  her perspective and acumen, and  most \nimportant ly, the unshakable resolve she brought to the study of Korean history that convinced me \nto embark on this venture. Though she is not here today to witness its completion, her continuous \nconfidence and fin al words of encouragement inspired the tenacity to forge ahead in her absence.  \nThe days immediately following Professor Haboush\u2019s passing were  the most difficult. \nDorothy Ko\u2019s timely interventions ensured these  difficulties would be surmounted . The dedicat ed \nattention she offered one who became her charge by circumstance speaks  volumes of her intellectual \ngenerosity. During my final two years at Columbia , Jungwon Kim invested both mind and heart, not \nto mention countless  hours, to see to the project\u2019s compl etion. During the entire research and \nwriting process, they, along with my other committee members, Robert Hymes, Charles Armstrong, \nand Pamela Smith , entertained  many ideas of uncertain finish and read many drafts of varying \npolish. Together t hey have bee n pillars of steady support through these trying years and have never \nturned do wn a request, however untimely.  \nBefore graduate school, I spent four years of college at Columbia. I spent the bulk of my \ntime at the Department of East Asian Languages and Cult ures. Wendy Swartz, Shang Wei, Theodore \ndeBary and Rachel Chung encouraged me to major in East Asian studies and to pursue my interests \nfurther in graduate school. I have benefited from the intellectual community here at large, but the \nnumerous enlightenin g conversations over the years with David Lurie, Gray Tuttle, Eugenia Lean, \nand Theodore Hughes have been particularly memorable. I also thank my Korean language teach ers \nover the years, Carol Schulz, Yunhee Lee, Hyunkyu Yi and Beom Lee whose patient instr uction \nhave made this all possible.

This dissertation makes \nseveral related arguments about these relations and the practice of diplomacy during this period. The \nfirst is that the Chos \u014fn Korean court co -constructed empire with the Ming in order to shape, frame, \nand ultimately delimit Ming sovereign claims. To make  empire pliable to its interests, Chos \u014fn \ntailored its interactions to suit imperial desires of political r ecognition from Chos \u014fn and pretenses to \nuniversal rule.  \nThe second is that acts like the ritual of tribute, the writing of envoy poetry, or the \nprofession of loyalty to the Ming created what no w appears in retrospect to be the stable, reified \nstructure of tributary relations. Whereas prevailing narratives of Chos \u014fn-Ming relations explains \nKorean diplomatic practices as compliance with a Sinocentric world view or an ideology of \u201cServing \nthe Greater\u201d (Kr: sadae ju \u016di \u4e8b\u5927\u4e3b\u7fa9 ) that upheld a stable \u201ctributary syste m,\u201c I contend that what \nappears as stable ideology is in fact a product of the strategic use of language, ritual and other forms \nof representation in the context of diplomatic practice.  \nAt stake in these relations were Korea \u2019s political autonomy, cultural prestige, and position in \na transnational imaginary of political order that was controlled by a counterpart who dwarfed it in \nsize and power. The third argument is that Chos \u014fn was able to maintain a space of agency by \ncultivating a favorable dynamic of knowledge asymmetry in which Korea", "doc_id": "8221e2ef-49c5-4558-b9fd-21102046662f", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "77b4171b9ca6e2b93432ae04de4195d89146398b8f436c1d84da69dc35a0b59e", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 28176, "end": 30442}, "relationships": {"1": "f47394fe-94c7-4ac0-a316-a92b37a55a86", "2": "f5b3e308-0676-4382-a431-3f36a02700f0", "3": "fadd2399-95d0-461f-aaa1-17ddf252b506"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "fadd2399-95d0-461f-aaa1-17ddf252b506": {"__data__": {"text": "\u2019s political autonomy, cultural prestige, and position in \na transnational imaginary of political order that was controlled by a counterpart who dwarfed it in \nsize and power.

In other \nwords, w homever Korea paid tribute to was the legitimate empire; it was the vassal who made the \nruler.  \nCenturies of diplomatic exchange has left a documentary record abound in declarations of \nKorean fealty and proclamations of the Ming emperor \u2019s universal sovereig nty. In a preface to a Ming \nenvoy poetry anthology, Hong S \u014fm \u6d2a\u66b9  (1504 \u20131585), the Chos \u014fn court \u2019s most esteemed literary \nofficial hailed the Ming as \u201cthe August court who receives its brilliant mandate from heaven. \u201d The \nMing emperor was the \u201cSon of Heaven \u201d who \u201csuccored a myriad realms, \u201d extending its influence by \npromulgating its calendar to the \u201cmarches of the eight [directions].\u201d Hong was proud that Chos \u014fn \nKorea, a \u201chumble country occupying the sea \u2019s edge, \u201d was treated by the Ming \u201cno differently than \nits interior territories.\u201d2 If the wages of time had spared on ly this fragment of the documentary \nrecord from destruction, a modern reader could only conclude that the Chos \u014fn saw itself as an \nintegral part of the Ming empire.  \nA far richer textual record survives, but much of it seems only to corroborate the story. We  \nknow that the Chos \u014fn king compared himself to Ming princes of the blood, sharing with him the \ntitles of wang (\u738b) and wearing the same regalia. His court observed the Ming imperial calendar and \nhe ruled with Ming patents of investiture ( komy\u014fng/ gaoming \u8aa5\u547d ) that demonstrated the derivation \n                                                 \n2 The collecti on was the 1567 edition of the Brilliant Flowers  (Hwanghwajip \u7687\u83ef\u96c6 ), which celebrated the arrival of the \nambassadors from Ming China \u660e (1368 \u20131644) to Korea, then ruled by the Chos \u014fn dynasty , to proclaim the accession \nof the Wanli Emperor \u842c\u66c6  (r.

Chos \u014fn operated as its own state, with institutions \nmirroring those of the imperial court. It sought to monopolize legitimate violence in its own  \ndomain, contested Ming territorial claims on its hinterland, taxed its population and tried to confine \nthem within its borders.

To do so, I propose that any historical empire can also be parsed as a transection \nof three interrelated and mutually reinforcing registers that each comprise a separate, but integral \ndimensions of the total phenomena. They are empire as 1) a spatial -political entity, 2) a series of \ninterconnected social configurations that sustain or are engendered by that entity, 3) a political \nimaginary buttressed by representations, ideologies, and discourses.

Both Mongol -Yuan and the Ming were such states. Arguably, so were \nthe Kory \u014f and the Chos \u014fn, who fit each of these definitions, with the only palpable distinction between the Korean \nkingdoms and the Yuan and Ming imperiums the distinction of scale.  \n17 These are the main issues treated in Jane Burbank and Frederick Cooper, Empires in World History: Power and the Politics \nof Difference  (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 2010).  \n18 Philip Abrams, \u201cNotes on the Difficulty of Studying the State, Journal of Historical Sociology  vol. 1, no.1 March 1988, \n58\u201359. \n \n 8  institutions, military organization, commercial networks, flows of information, ethnic, religious, or \ncorporate solidarities that make imperial power possible.

Given the diversity of actors and prac tices involved, means \nof persuasion are seldom monolithic and constant across social and geographic space.

The \nrelationship between empire as an imperial state and the second and third registers of empire can  \nalso be thought of in terms of emergent properties, where the latter registers emerge from the first. \nCommon parlance regarding American empire is illustrative of this understanding.

The official policies \nof the United States may help engender new political relations, business interests, and cultural \ninfluences that slice across not only American society, but also the rest of the world.20 What results, \nhowever, are a plethora of dynamics that fall outside of the control of the American state. \nNonetheless, the United States still attempts to control these dynamics by exercising its \u201cimperial\u201d \nprerogatives, acting in the name of universal standards and global  peace and  prosperity, often \nthrough multinational institutions, such as NATO, the United Nations or the World Bank.  \nEmpire is therefore conceptually related to the desire to control, reflected in the \netymological origins of the English term \u201cempire\u201d in the Roman concept of imperium \u2014the power of \nmilitary command, which enabled the control of peoples, territories, and resources. Military control, \nhowever, also tend s to spawn new political, economic, and cultural connections that elude control, \nmotivating the design of new institutions to establish it. One is reminded of how the British East \nIndia Company \u2019s activities invited wider and more frequent interventions by the British crown, as \nwhat began as audacious and rapacious commercial ventures became a project of territorial empire.21 \nThe zealous generals of Rome, like the nineteenth -century colonizers of India and Africa, secured \ntheir new acquisitions by conquering the environs of their new territories.22 The most obvious \nparallel in the case of the Ming, and later Qing, context, is the gradual integration of wide swathes of \nupland Southeast Asia into the imperium. State concerns with frontier security led to the \nencouragement of Chinese settlement in aboriginal regions, which in turn led to conflicts over land \n                                                 \n20 E.

Burbank and Cooper describes these patterns as a \u201cfundame ntal political \ndynamic\u201d that rested on the \u201cexternalization of sources of wealth,\u201d which incentivized and \n\u201cemboldened\u201d rulers to \u201ccollect resources in a regular...way, to facilitate the incorporation of new \npeoples \u2019 territories, and trade routes without im posing uniformity in culture or administration.\u201d A \nresource -oriented understanding of empire, while accurate for many macropolitical formations and \nable to explain many aspects of empire -making in East Asia, still does not fully account for the \nChos \u014fn-Ming relationship.24 The practice of empire is not only about expansion, but also laying \nclaims of authority to justify that expansion. While there were certainly extractive incentives for the \nMing, motivations for constructing a Ming political imaginary  that extended to Chos \u014fn had less to \ndo with the acquisition of material resources than of ideological ones. In other words, it was about \nclaims of authority.  \nThe importance of authority claims again point to the persuasive dimension of empire. This \nration alization of the desire for control is what Negri and Hardt have identified as \u201cempire\u201d as a \n\u201cjuridical concept,\u201d where empire is conceived as political power in the service of \u201cutopias of \n\u2018perpetual peace. \u2019\u201d Chos \u014fn and Ming diplomats who spoke of Ming rul e in these terms did not \n                                                 \n23 Note the dialectic relationship betwe en processes like migration and attempts of the state to maintain control.

In this dialectic interplay, new horizons of desire gave rise \nto new persuasive technologies that legitimized claims of control.  \nIn sum, a history of empire is therefore conceived less as a history of parti cular imperial \nstates than as a history of issues related to the process of empire -making. Much as a good economic \nhistory is concerned not only with questions of exchange, wealth, value, productivity, and material \naccretion, but also with the institutions , ideas, and discourses surrounding these issues, a history of \nempire grapples with questions of sovereignty and authority, and the extension of these claims \nacross geographical, cultural and ethnic zones, in addition to the technologies, institutions, and  \nideologies that support, challenge, and inform these claims.  \nEmpire, Territory, and Sovereignty  \nUsing empire as an analytical framework allows us to compare the diverse empire -making \nexperiences of the Ottoman, British, Manchu, American, Roman and other imperial formations by \nforegrounding common historical questions.

After all, is not the term \u201cempire\u201d an imposition from \ncontemporary, Western analytical vocabulary?

Instead, \nas JaHyun Kim Haboush has argued, there needs to be a \u201cmutual accommodation between the new \nuser and old usage: the  new user searches and employs words of best approximation from the \nWestern regime; conversely, the new usage should be assimilated into the old word, and the new \nusage becomes another possible meaning of this word.\u201d26 The task at hand then is to first reco gnize \nthe repertoire of practices, including their persuasive technologies, distinct to each imperial \nformation. Then, by understanding how they operated in their cultural and historical context, i.e. \nthat of Chos \u014fn-Ming relations, we can expand our own no tions of empire to tell a more inclusive \nhistory.  \nUnderstanding early modern empire in East Asia hinges on the concept of t\u2019ong (Ch: tong \n\u7d71).

Difficulties emerged not simply because of divergent notions of sovereignty and \nterritoriality, but because these notions were ideological linchpins for competing interests and James Louis  Hevia, \nCherishing Men from Afar: Qing Guest Ritual and the Macartney Embassy of 1793  (Durham: Duke University Press, 1995)  25, \n28. \n \n 17  recognized the \u201cincomplete and tentative nature of more expansive spheres of influence.\u201d In o ther \nwords, the origins of modern territorial sovereignty in a European empire \u2019s gradual \u201crationalization \nof space\u201d had a contingent history, developing out of a complex interaction between a variety of \ncompeting practices of sovereignty and jurisdiction.40 Since all forms of sovereign thinking are \nhistorically contingent, the task at hand is to historicize them.  \nSovereign thinking was certainly not foreign to East Asia. Li Chen \u2019s discussion of the late \nQing case offers an illustrative example. The Qing did  maintain \u201csovereignty,\u201d if defined as a \n\u201csupreme authority of an independent state or imperial formation to administer matters within the \ngeographical boundaries... under its effective control.\u201d It, however, did not always exercise sovereign \nprerogatives according to the expectation of international law, such as \u201cthe strict enforcement of its \nlaw against all foreign offenders within its territory.\u201d Furthermore, Qing notions of sovereignty was \ncomplicated in several ways by the extension of its influence ov er its \u201ctributary states,\u201d especially \nChos \u014fn Korea.41 The first is what \u201ceffective control\u201d means. Did it entail enforcement of law, \nmilitary domination and deciding policy? This leads to the second issue, the nature of sovereign \nprerogatives. What if sover eign prerogatives did not entail the above, but questions of ceremonial \npractice and dynastic succession, and were coded not in geographical terms, but temporal ones? \nAnd, finally how did Chos \u014fn Korea understand Qing sovereign claims?  \nThe Chos \u014fn court saw its political autonomy not as a grant by an imperial sovereign, but as \nfundamentally rooted in its own internal transmission of political legitimacy, ideas which once \nshaped its relations with the Ming as well. In effect, the Chos \u014fn court ruled a territori ally sovereign \nstate, but one whose sovereignty was hierarchically defined vis -a-vis that of an imperial claim to \n                                                 \n40 Benton, A Search for Sovereignty , 3\u201339.

Although the \ncontroversy was in theory limited to the status of an ancient kingdom, because Kogury \u014f\u2019s territory spanned modern \nNorth Korea and Chinese Manchuria, the debate can easily be seen as a proxy for debates  over territorial sovereignty, \nespecially given Korea \u2019s irredentist views on Manchuria.

When the Chos \u014fn was first \nestablished, it had to contend with a series of border disputes with the Ming that lingered from the \ncollapse of Mongol -Yuan rule. These concerned the jurisdicti on of areas north of the Yalu river in \nLiaodong, which had formerly been an appanage of a Kory \u014f prince during the Yuan, but had been \nannexed by the Ming, and a wide swath of land north of Ch \u014flly\u014fng pass in Hamgy \u014fng province in \nmodern North Korea, which was  had been annexed by the Mongols, but now returned partly to \nChos \u014fn control.49 Against the backdrop of these tense relations, one Korean envoy Kw \u014fn K\u016dn \u6b0a\n\u8fd1 (1352 \u20131409), dispatched to the Ming in 1396, alluded to these territorial questions in an poem \non the Yalu River, written on the command of the Ming emperor:50 \n                                                 \n48 Since I am advocating, as Haboush does, a \u201cmutual accommodat ion between the new user and old usage,\u201d where \n\u201cnew usage\u201d is \u201cassimilated into the old word,\u201d it also follows that terms like cheguk/diguo might not one day acquire the \nanalytical suppleness that \u201cempire\u201d has acquired through comparative research. The que stion is simply whether the \nscholarly discourse in modern Korean and Chinese would support this sort of new \u201cusage\u201d at this current moment.

Kw \u014fn\u2019s couplet, \nhowever, denied the river the power of demarcation. In contrast to the Ming emperor, who in his \nown poem saw the Yalu River as reminder of conf lict a place \u201cdotted with ruins of ancient \nfortresses,\u201d the remnants of wars over contested land; in Kw \u014fn\u2019s rendering, the river became a a \nmere fact of geography, one whose divisive power melted away in the face of the Ming \u2019s all-\nembracing imperial influe nce.

A whole body of knowledge \ndeveloped around the question of transmission that debated not only the lines of legitimate descent \nbut also the various practices and precedents they offered.56 Dynastic histories, classical texts (and \ntheir commentaries), literary paeans, and works of statecraft sustained this transmissi on.

Its pretension to \nantiquity could only be sustained because enough people found the imperial tradition useful enough \nto appropriate a nd reinvent. Claims of political authority within the same imperial tradition are \nmutually legible, and often speak to similar issues, but they do not always say the same thing. A \nreigning emperor could draw on the deeds of past rulers as rationales for hi s decisions. Likewise, an \nimperial official could borrow the authority of the classics to justify a policy position. The actions of \na well -evaluated past ruler were more readily acceptable as models for emulation, while the deeds of \npoor rulers would often  be cited to criticize contemporary policy.

This vision was useful because of Korea \u2019s \npeculiar place within the imperial tradition. In imperial histories, Korea had been represented as a \ntarget of con quest, a territory properly within the pale of direct rule.

One precedent sitting above another made alternative an d often contradictory \ninterpretations possible. The imperial tradition had the quality of a palimpsest.63 Its selective reading \nthen becomes a powerful technique of negotiation. Just as the devil may cite scripture to suit his \npurpose, any Confucian scholar  can find some turn of phrase in some authoritative text to make \nlegitimate what may otherwise have been a radical claim. The task of a Chos \u014fn envoy was to turn \nimperial policy away from precedents unfavorable for Korean goals towards others that were more \nconducive to their interests. In reading their tactics, it is important to not mistake the discourse for \nthe utterance.

Fairbank and his collaborators were clear that they never intended the \u201cChinese Wo rld Order\u201d to serve as \nan equivalent of the \u201ctributary system\u201d or a description of how East Asian interstate relations actually worked. In fact, \nthis study was intended as a critique of Sinocentric perspectives in both imperial texts and the field of Sinol ogy during \nthe time, where the Chinese view was taken for granted. The irony is that The Chinese World Order produced a rather \nunintended, and contrary effect. S ubsequent studies inspired by his framework have instead reified the ideological \nconcepts that Fairbank had called a \u201cnormative pattern\u201d into historical \u201cfact.\u201d The root of this problem lies in Fairbank \u2019s \nmotivations for his critique of Sinocentrism. Fairbank had sought to distill a paradigmatic understanding of the \n \n 29  In other words, it was also the discourse of diplomacy, the way interpolity relations were talked \nabout by historical actors themselves.  \nThe \u201ctributary system\u201d has oriented the study of Korean diplomatic history across multiple \nacademic communities.70 In lieu of \u201ctributary relations,\u201d Korean and Japanese scholars tend to \nprefer a variation of the term \u201ctribute -investiture system\u201d (Kr: chogong -chaekpong ch \u2019egye, Jp: ch\u014dk\u014d \u2013\nsakuf\u016b  taikei \u671d\u8ca2\u518a\u5c01\u9ad4\u7cfb ) or the general notion of a regional East Asian order.71 Sinophone \nscholars also use this terminology as well, but also use \u201csuzerain -vassal institutions\u201d (Ch: zongfan tizhi \n\u5b97\u85e9\u9ad4\u5236 ) or (Ch: zongfan guanxi \u5b97\u85e9\u95dc\u4fc2 ).72 As Koo Bumjin h as argued, despite their diverse \n                                        ", "doc_id": "aa53b980-2f36-4869-b472-13e47daf5112", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "69a89494f17bc0c15633c6062efe9dd564dccd8c1537b8677de81d7dd3f3589c", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 107844, "end": 110792}, "relationships": {"1": "f47394fe-94c7-4ac0-a316-a92b37a55a86", "2": "02d1ea43-16f1-4895-9582-dcc9b3a751e0", "3": "9ffd1962-35ca-4c04-bca3-b0b3369b6ffa"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "9ffd1962-35ca-4c04-bca3-b0b3369b6ffa": {"__data__": {"text": ") or (Ch: zongfan guanxi \u5b97\u85e9\u95dc\u4fc2 ).72 As Koo Bumjin h as argued, despite their diverse \n                                                 \n\u201ctributary system\u201d in order to co ntrast it with Westphalian diplomacy, rather than investigate the historical development \nof the \u201ctributary system\u201d per se.

These are related to a second problem, that of contextual and diachronic perspective, where \nan overarc hing, stable model is upheld at the expense of historical specificity and resolution. The \nfinal problem, which is in turn related to the discounting of Korean agency, is the inadequate \naccounting the role of ritual and literary practices in the constructio n of \u201ctributary relations.\u201d  \nThe problem of Sinocentrism is in many ways inherent to the paradigm.

While geopolitical considerations \noften meant that interstate politics were intertwined with one another such metaphors and characterizations borrowed \nfrom the discourse of modern international affairs work poorly in the early modern East Asian context.  \n To elevate Korea \u2019s experience in the \u201ctributary system\u201d into an overridi ng structure that encompasses East \nAsia only makes sense from a vantage point at the hub of the proverbial wheel. In East Asia, tributary system(s) nearly \nalways operated bilaterally, and its defining institutional features could be reproduced locally. A c enter could be \nconstructed vis -a-vis one \u2019s neighbors, but seldom do these \u201cworld orders\u201d cohere into something universal. Kenneth \nRobinson, for instance, has shown how a Korean -centered \u201cworld order\u201d could be constructed in parallel with a Sino -\ncentric one  in the fifteenth and sixteenth century, using many of the same ritual and institutional technologies. The \ndifferent ways the distinction between \u201ccivilization\u201d and \u201cbarbarity\u201d was understood in China, Japan, and Korea during \nthis period illustrate these d isjunctures aptly. The ideational \u201cworld orders\u201d used to interpret these phenomena did not \ncohere together.  \n There was also no institutional forum where Koreans, Japanese, Ryukyuan, Vietnamese and Chinese envoys \nworked together. The only place of tangible , multi -lateral state contact in this period, was, in fact, the (Ming) imperial \ncapital, but even there contact between various groups was rare. Anecdotal exceptions of Koreans meeting Vietnamese \nenvoys in Beijing are an exception. In other words, there wa s not an overarching multilateral political order to speak of. \nThis discrete bilaterality distinguishes East Asia from the multi -state system of early modern Europe and the current \nglobal system. (Notably, unlike the European nobility who intermarried and often traveled across Europe, by the \nfifteenth century, East Asian political elites operated in a space that was coterminous with the territorial boundaries of \nthe states to which they owed their allegiance.)  \n All this is not to say there was no geopolitic al structure that bound these states together or that the structural \nlinkages of trade and exchange were moot, but simply that they had no counterpart at the level of political institutions. \nWhereas the Fairbankean Chinese \u201cworld order\u201d is merely conceptua l, the East Asian world order is only an exchange \nstructure, lacking a conceptual counterpart in the realm of political discourse. If one must speak of \u201cworld orders,\u201d one \nshould recognize that they were inherently self -centered and solipsistic.  \nSee Kenne th R.

Although New \nQing historians like Evelyn Rawski, Mark Elliot, Pamela Crossley, and  Yao Dali have convincingly demonstrated the \nimportance of Inner Asian traditions in Qing empire -making, the once dominant narrative of the gradual Sinicization of \nthe Manchus remains a strong counterpoint. While there is a case to be made for either posit ion, there is a tendency for \nthe \u201cSinicization\u201d camp to ignore experiences, archives, and perspectives of polities and ethnic groups who have a \ndifferent story to tell. The details of this politically charged debate is tangential to this study, but it is i mportant to \nrecognize that those who argue in favor of \u201cSiniciziation\u201d rarely interrogate the assumption that imperial institutions, \nConfucian classics, and literary Chinese were inherently \u201cChinese\u201d (Han \u6f22) objects, the adoption of which made one \nSinicize d. This perspective is untenable from the Korean perspective. For Chos \u014fn Koreans, there was no question that \nthese objects were technologies that originated in China, but they often viewed as elements of a universal civilization \nrooted in a classical past.  Therefore, in the Korean context, appropriation of these objects should be distinguished from \nan ethno -cultural transformation implied in the term \u201cSinicization\u201d ( Hanhua ). Simply put, Koreans adopted these cultural \nparaphernalia and did not become \u201cChines e\u201d or Han.  \n Ultimately, the debate thus hinges on how closely one seeks to identify particular technologies of statecraft and \ncultural practices as inherently \u201cChinese.\u201d To describe how Koreans viewed with the authority of things \u201cChinese,\u201d a \ndifferent ter m, confusingly coined, \u201cChos \u014fn Sinocetrism \u201d (Chos\u014fn Chunghwa chu \u016di \u671d\u9bae\u4e2d\u83ef\u4e3b\u7fa9 ) has been used in \nKorean language scholarship.

These were all related concepts, but these registers were not \ncoterminous, even if they were often conflated. E ven Chos \u014fn period discourse is not always clear whether a particular \ninstance what the term Chunghwa  (or its related terms) in fact refers to. Nonethel ess, Chunghwa,  a civilizational tradition, \nthe state, or a geographical or ethnic marker, could be disaggregated at times and it is clear that these things had distinct , \nthough linked conceptual livelihoods. In other words, any combination of meanings are in theory possible when \nChunghwa  was used in the Chos \u014fn context. For this reason, this dissertation will translate Chunghwa differently to capture \nthe semantic scope, depending on the context. A different reading, however, may lead to different interpretat ions. \n Chunghwa chu \u016di, then,  really points to several distinct registers of phenomena. On the analytical level, it is a \ncritique of Sinocentric historical methodologies or perspectives. When placed in Chos \u014fn history, it points to a Korean \nview of imperial China as an axis mundi. But, it also points to Chos \u014fn adoption of the Confucian universalism of the \nimperial project and institutions derived either from contemporary Chinese examples or classical models. Finally, for the \nlate Chos \u014fn period, it can also re fer to how Koreans saw themselves as the new center of civilization and guardian of the \nclassical tradition, a \u201cSmall Central Efflorescence,\u201d ( So Chunghwa/ Xiao Zhonghua ) to replace a lost axis mundi  after the fall \nof the Ming to the Manchus.  \nFor the \u201cSin icization\u201d debate and New Qing History, see Evelyn S.

Nonetheless, as \nLiam Kelley and Kathlene Baldanza have argued it is not enough to see Vietnamese relations with the Ming and Qing \nonly in terms of resistance to Chinese imperial authority.

Others, like Pak W \u014fnhyo and Kim Sunja see  their studies as \ndocumenting the establishment the beginning of \u201ctypical \u201d tributary relations ( ch\u014fnhy\u014fng ch\u014fgin chogong -chaekpong kwan \u2019gye) by \nthe early fifteenth century, which served as the foundation of relations through the end of the early mdoern per iod. \nAlthough these authors differ on when relations truly \u201cstabilized,\u201d they all identify the significance of the fifteenth \ncentury in terms of inaugurating a new phase of Sino -Korean relations.

Chos \u014fn Korea was a \u201cmodel \u201d tributary because it functioned as an ideal tributary state \nshould; and, it was also \u201cparadigmatic\u201d for best illustrating how the tributary system worked.

To explain Chos \u014fn-Ming relations as an example of \u201ctributary \nrelation s\u201d is to say nothing more than Chos \u014fn-Ming relations operated like itself. It would be \nanalogous to stating that the European Union is a representative example of a \u201ctransnational order \u201d \nand defining, a priori , that \u201ctransnational order\u201d is whatever the Eu ropean Union happens to be. \nWhat does it mean when an example is paradigmatic, and yet is, essentially, the model of itself?  \nThe problem is not only logical, but also empirical.

Quite prevalent in Sinophone scholarship, i t attributes Chos \u014fn\u2019s tributary \nrelationship with the Ming to the affinity toward Chinese civilization on the part of the Korean elite. \nThere is a grain of truth to this, since some members of the Chos \u014fn elite did exhibit admiration for \nMing elite culture.  Those who traveled to China as envoys often took pride in having done so. \nHowever, explanation is both logically recursive and empirically reductive. For one, affinity towards \nChinese culture does not necessarily inspire the desire for political allegianc e. Furthermore, the \nprimary evidence for ascribing Korean political allegiance to \u201cadmiration\u201d of \u201cChinese civilization\u201d \nis Korean participation in the tributary exchange and statements gleaned from Chos \u014fn envoys, who \noften expressed them explicitly for an imperial audience. We cannot then use this professed \nadmiration as the sole explanatory cause for the phenomena of tributary relations, when tributary \nrelations was the evidence for this admiration in t he first place.

Literary expressions in envoy poetry or \ndiplomatic missives, which form the core of this dissertation, became, along with Chos \u014fn tribute \nmissions and Ming enfeoffment of Korean rule rs, rituals that either reflected a preexisting hierarchical \norder between the Ming as suzerain and the Chos \u014fn as its tributary and showed Korean adherence \nto a particular ideology.108 In short, Chos \u014fn and Ming diplomatic practices were effectively black -\nboxed in the paradigm of \u201ctributary relations.\u201d Since how these relations operate is already \ntheorized, further scrutiny of these cultural practices may offer additional texture, detail, or subtlety, \nbut have no potential to fundamentally alter our historical  understanding.  \nTo read cultural production only as subordinate to or as byproduct of the structure of \ntributary relations , however, fundamentally distorts the role of cultural production.  I argue \nsomething of th e converse: that the \u201cstructure\u201d of the trib utary system actually emerged from \nliterary and cultural practices. To understand how this worked, we must open the figurative black \nbox of the \u201ctributary system\u201d and examine Korean diplomatic practices, not as reflective, but as \nconstitutive, with the pot ential to alter the terms and even the structure of a relationship.  \n                                                 \n107 This, of course, is not exclusive to the Korean experience and equally a pplies to those who lived in lands \nadministered by the imperial state.  \n108 For instance, Du Huiyue, in her own magisterial literary history of Chos \u014fn envoy poetry, largely views envoy poetry \nas a conduit for the transmission of Chinese culture and literary e xchange within the framework of tributary relations. \nShe calls the Anthology of Brilliant Flowers , a \u201ccrystallization\u201d of literary exchange and treats ideology and the political \nrelationship to be determinative of the poetry \u2019s content.

The  approach needs to sidestep the \nhistoriographical rut created by generations of scholarship on premodern East Asian relations that \nhas largely treated ideology as determinative of, rather than constituted by cultural practices. Rather \nthan a diplomatic his tory in the traditional sense, I propose something methodologically akin to a \n\u201ccultural history of diplomacy.\u201d In lieu of what states and their actors negotiated and contested, it \ncenters on the practice  of official interaction and what was produced from  it.109 \nI eschew the use of the \u201ctributary system\u201d as an overarching framework;110 nonetheless, by \nthinking of Chos \u014fn-Ming diplomatic relations in terms of a history of empire, I am still interested in \nthe macro -historical questions that the tributary framework was meant to answer, such as how the \nChos \u014fn and the Ming maintained stable relations over two centuries. It, however, shifts the search \nfor causality in what Karen Barkey has called the \u201cmeso \u2013\u201d level of \u201cintermediary spaces.\u201d111 \nInstitutional actors such as Korean and Chinese envoys and interpreters, who operated as go -\nbetweens for the Chos \u014fn and Ming courts, come to the fore as central protagonists of this story.112 \n                                                 \n109 Such a history does not see diplomacy merely as a window into intern ational politics, but rather historicizes the \npractices, rituals, and conventions of diplomacy itself. Although the practice of diplomacy is fundamental to any kind of \ninterstate politics, there has been remarkably little English language work on early mod ern or premodern diplomacy \nsince Garret Mattingly \u2019s classic treatise on Renaissance diplomacy, though there are notable recent exceptions.

At this level of analysis, their seemingly minute interactions \u2014letter \nexchanges, envoy poetry, ceremonial displays \u2014constitute and ultimately shape ideological and \nstructural patterns.  \nA history of empire in early Chos \u014fn is also a story of how the Chos \u014fn court grappled with \nthe Ming to comprehend their relationship, so that it could control \u2014 bring sense, regularity, and \npredictability to its dynamics. Chos \u014fn-Ming diplomacy often engendered processes that eluded the \ntotal control of either party. Pervasive smuggling and illicit trade under the cover of tributary \nmissions, activities which sometimes threatened the feasibility and operation of envoy exchange \nitself, are cases in point. A parallel dynamic can be observed on t he level of cultural and ideological \nconstruction as well. The Chos \u014fn court interpolated Korea into the cultural and ideological \nconstructs of the Ming. It helped reinforce Ming imperial authority that, in theory, extended to all -\nunder -heaven. These constructs did not truly comprise a \u201cworld order,\u201d at least insomuch as \u201c order\u201d \nimplies a comprehensibility, legibility, and coherence between the imagined and the observed. It was \ninstead a desire of order \u2014an imposition of coherence that could make all the messy complexities \nlegible to the interests of the Chos \u014fn and Ming cour ts. In short, all the hackneyed representations in \nhistorical sources thought of as emblematic of the \u201ctributary system \u201d and the \u201cChinese World \nOrder \u201d\u2014not least of all the notion that the Ming ruler was a virtuous universal sovereign and the \nChos \u014fn king wa s his loyal vassal \u2014were only that, representations. These narratives of how the \nrelationship worked were hopelessly imperfect, often a result of many distillations of the phenomena \nthey supposedly described. Such descriptions, however, were neither acciden tal nor inert. \nRepresentations did not only describe , they enabled . By structuring the world and making diverse, often \ncomplex phenomena legible, these representations constituted a form of knowledge, a regime of \ninterpretation that made action, and theref ore, agency possible.  \n \n 46  The Korean construction of a vision of Chos \u014fn and its place in empire should be seen as an \ninvestment in what I refer to as a \u201cknowledge of empire.\u201d By \u201cknowledge,\u201d I am thinking in terms \nof two distinct, but related forms.

The \nfirst form of knowledge is found in the constructs produced from a dialectic relationship between \nthe epistemic structures and the phenomenological \u201creality\u201d they were meant to comprehend.

A tactic ( connaissance ), insofar as it acknowledges the \nepistemic structures ( savoir ) it seeks to manipulate or circumvent, not only constructs and reinforces \nthem, but also requires that they are readil y legible; otherwise the tactic is both meaningless and \nineffectual.  \nIn the context of this discussion of early Chos \u014fn diplomacy, \u201cknowledge of empire\u201d refers \nboth to the act of constructing \u201cempire\u201d as a legible entity and the tactics that allow Chos \u014fn agents \nto navigate them.

The relationship between mastery and politics was thus dialectic; the political demands of \ndiplomacy encouraged mastery, while mastery further linked Korea to empire.  \n                                                 \n115 Chos \u014fn diplomatic strategy had antecedents in the way the Kory \u014f engaged with the Mongol -Yuan in the 1260s, the \nKory \u014f saw its autonomy drastically curtailed. Although the Mongol emperor K hubilai Khan had initially assured the \nsurvival of the Kory \u014f royal house, the situation remained precarious throughout the Mongol period. During this period, \nthe Kory \u014f court pursued a number of strategies to ensure its survival, including pursuing marital ties with the imperial \nfamily. Among the strategies the Kory \u014f pursued was to recast its capitulation not as an ignoble surrender, but as their \nown recognition of imperial destiny. Their submission then, served to legitimize the Mongol dynasty.

The geopoliti cal reality of \nvast differentials of power meant that Korea had to reckon with a neighbor whose superior \ncommand of human and natural resources loomed as a serious existential threat, while Korea \u2019s \nstatus as a target of irredentist ambitions in certain int erpretations of the imperial tradition meant \nthat a potential rationalization for the obliteration of any Korean state always lurked in the shadows. \nLetters written to imperial throne had to reckon with the very real, though often unspoken, potential \nof ov erwhelming imperial power in the form of an invading army, but, more often than not, used \nthe opportunity to create and fashion an imperial image, not only one of august majesty, infinite \npower, but also one that was tempered, rational, merciful, and most importantly, civilized.  \nEven if Chos \u014fn were to ignore the legitimating technologies of its imperial neighbor, \nrefusing to participate in its construction of authority, the peculiar place of Korea within the imperial \ntradition meant that Korea, as an object of imperial desire, would never be free from the gaze of \nempire. The Korean choice to participate in the construction of empire could be construed, as \nCh\u014fng Chiy \u014fng has, as a \u201cweapon of the weak. \u201d Rather than deny imperial claims outright, it sought \nto alter them, using the \u201ctools of the ma ster,\u201d the language of empire itself. Therefore, the \neffectiveness of diplomatic rhetoric required anticipating how the privileged imperial observer looks \nupon a \u201cbarbarian Other,\u201d \u201cinfantaliz[ing] and trivializ[ing] what [its gaze] falls upon.\u201d116 Chos \u014fn \nhad to be made legible to the imperial agent who presumed his own cultural values universal and \nparamount.

The first tactic was \u201cautoethnography.\u201d Mary Louise Pra tt uses \u201cautoethnography\u201d to \n\u201c[refer] to instances in which colonized subjects undertake to represent themselves in ways that \nengage with  the colonizer \u2019s terms.\u201d These texts \u201c[collaborated] with and [appropriated] the idioms of \nthe conqueror.\u201d117 Korean draf ters of diplomatic missives and the envoys who bore them were ever \nconscientious of what the imperial tradition meant to their audience and composed their letters, \npoems, and memorials to be legible to them.  \nThough the Chos \u014fn-Ming situation shares the asy mmetrical power dynamics of a colonial \ncontext, it differs fundamentally in one important way. The \u201ccolonizer \u2019s terms,\u201d in this case the \ndiscourse of the imperial histories and classics, had long been appropriated and owned by the \nKorean elite since at lea st the seventh century, if not earlier. This distinction is an important caveat. \nThe colonial context of autoethnography implies a degree of alienation between the colonized \nsubject and the discourse of the colonized; this kind of alienation was not presen t for early modern \nKorea. The Chos \u014fn court never doubted its ecumenical membership or saw itself to be any less a \nlegitimate heir of the classical past than the Ming. Nevertheless, \u201cautoethnography\u201d is appropriate \nbecause a Korean envoy often had to conten d with Ming counterparts, whose attitudes towards \nempire were strongly colored by notions of cultural and ethnic superiority. Imperial officials often \ndescribed Koreans as \u201cbarbarians\u201d (Ch: waiyi, Kr: oei \u5916\u5937 ) and relegated them to the ecumenical \nmargin. Ko rean autoethnography then, sought to dispel the imperial gaze of what they considered to \nbe an erroneous view, but in doing so they had to elevate Korea in terms of imperial discourse, \nultimately acknowledging the discourse \u2019s legitimacy.  \nThe second rhetori cal tactic at work is what I call the \u201cimperializing mode.\u201d Whereas \nautoethnography was a mode of self -representation, the imperializing mode was a set of rhetorical \n                                                 \n117 Mary Louise Pratt, Imperial Eyes : Travel Writing and Transculturation  (London ; New York: Routledge, 1992), 9.  \n \n 50  tropes that brought to bear the normative elements of the imperial tradition to the table of \nnegotiation.

In this sense, the imperializing mode was hardly the exclusive property of Korean \nenvoys, but a manner of appeal that was quite common in the context of court politics. Courtiers \nwho found themselves needing remonstrate with recalcitrant rulers were in positions where power \nasymmetry could be quite severe, and resorted to this rhetorical strategy to achieve their own ends.118 \nBut, what made the use of this imperializing mode peculiar to the Korean context was how the \ntarget of persuasion shifted away fr om the imperial person. Imperial officials, military officers, \neunuch chamberlains, literati ministers and even private scholars all became its target as Korean \ndiplomats foisted the demands of imperial magnanimity onto them.  \nBy aligning Korean diplomatic goals with imperial prerogatives, the Chos \u014fn court was able \nto achieve its own ends without appearing to challenge imperial authority. Although the Ming was \nthe dominant party in this relationship, t he discourse of empire produced out of it was not one of \nMing hegemony, but rather a counter -hegemo nic one.119 It veiled Korean claims of sovereignty, \n                                                 \n118 The situation may be compared the court context of early China. Garret Olberding writes that when \u201can  erudite \nministerial subordinate addressed a perhaps intellectually inferior executive, the difference in their status, and the \nassociated norms of etiquette, were frequently vulnerable to irreverent contestation. Though the essence of political \npersuasion  ideally is the argument.... the political address must embrace both reasonable argument and unreasonable \nbias. Like the early Chinese minister, a Korean envoy often took an \u201cinstructive\u201d stance in his rhetoric when addressing \nemperors and imperial officia ls alike. In these situations, his \u201cdisposition remained mild and accommodating, avoiding to \nchallenge to the ruler \u2019s authority.\u201d In short, \u201chis aim was not to berate, but to cajole.\u201d Garret P.

The language of imperial adulation in Korean diplomatic writing, then, was never simply \n\u201clip-service\u201d or even \u201clegitimation.\u201d Their cumulative role in the  production of empire, especially \nwhen taken in the longue dur\u00e9e was in fact much more subtle, for they were the very substance of its \nconstruction.  \nForegrounding the strategic uses of language and representation also obviates the need to \ndetermine, once a nd for all, whether particular declarations reflected genuine sentiment. Rather than \ntry to pin down or distill what is authentic  from these declarations , I will embrace the ir diversity  and \nseek instead to locate the kinds of cultural and political work th ey were deployed to do. A discourse \nof \u201csincere\u201d subservience to the Ming and Korea as a loyal, \u201cideal tributary,\u201d should not be taken as \ntransparent description or historical fact but rather as strategic utterance infused with political intent.  \nWhat needs  to be avoided is an analysis that generalizes Chos \u014fn Korea as a \u201cmodel\u201d tributary state \nsimply because historical actors seems to suggest so. Doing so ignores the \u201ccultural work\u201d that such \nstatements performed in  a Korean strategy of self -representation . Rather than be seduced by such \nrepresentations, we can instead move towards a historicized understanding of how this notion came \ninto being and how it was used. This understanding will not only show how such representations in \nfact altered Chos \u014fn-Ming rela tions, but also reveal how Chos \u014fn appropriated Ming ideology and its \nimperial tradition as part of its diplomatic strategy.  \nThe Chos \u014fn made the preservation of Korean political autonomy a keystone concept in \ntheir vision of empire, and ultimately succeeded  in ensconcing it in the imperial tradition.

A mastery of a tactical form of knowledge, and the \ncooperation of its own agents, was indispensable . For this reason, Chos \u014fn\u2019s envoys, courtiers, and \ninterpreters kept records, collected poems, letters and memorial, and compiled institutional \nhandbooks and language manuals with the awareness that they would be consulted in the future. \nThe production of knowledge invested thes e discrete gestures of fashioning empire with lasting \nsignificance.

The \nvivid imperial presence that materialized in the historical record, then, was intimately tied to Korean \ndiplomatic strategy and the production of knowledge that guided it.

A \nfundamental tension thus emerges between the de sire of the Korean court to master and control this \nknowledge and the disparate sites and diffuse processes in which they come to be produced and \ndeployed.  \nWhat also emerged from the confluence of these processes is a dynamic of knowledge and \npower that is  also quite distinct from what has usually been observed between imperial \u201cmetropoles\u201d \n                                                 \non the original Siku bibliographies, such as the Xuxiu siku quanshu \u7e8c\u4fee\u56db\u5eab\u5168\u66f8 , the Siku quanshu cunmun congshu \u56db\u5eab\n\u5168\u66f8\u5b58\u76ee\u53e2\u66f8  and the Siku jinhuishu congshu \u56db\u5eab\u7981\u6bc0 \u66f8\u53e2\u66f8 . \n128 In particular Ni Qian \u2019s Chaoxian jishi \u671d\u9bae\u7d00\u4e8b , Zhang Ning \u2019s Fengshi lu \u5949\u4f7f\u9304 and Gong Yongqing \u2019s Shi \nChaoxian lu \u4f7f\u671d\u9bae\u9304 . \n129 For instance, Yan Congjian \u2019s Shuyu zhouzi lu \u6b8a\u57df\u5468\u54a8\u9304  and Mao Ruizheng \u2019s Huang Ming xiangxu kao  \u7687\u660e\u8c61\u80e5\n\u8003. \n \n 56  and their \u201cperipheries.\u201d Rather than a central archive that foregrounds the experience and \nperspective of imperial rule, what we have that squarely centers the experienc e of the peripheral.

Each of the first three chapters deal with one aspect of \nearly Chos \u014fn diplomacy with the Ming that have not been fully accounted for by long -standing \ninterpr etations of Chos \u014fn-Ming relations. They are: the presentation of diplomatic memorials, the \npolitical ramifications of ecumenical discourse, and the importance of intelligence gathering for \nenvoy missions. Chapter 1 deconstructs a prevailing stereotype of C hos\u014fn Korea as the Ming \u2019s \n\u201cmost loyal tributary,\u201d by examining Korean diplomatic memorials preserved in the fifteenth century \nChos \u014fn court compilation, the Literary Selections of the East . It argues Korean memorial composers \nappropriated a genre of imperia l encomium to interpolate into a process of imperial legitimation. \nChapter 2 examines how Chos \u014fn envoys also held Ming officials responsible in a similar manner in \ntheir letters of appeal.

These ideals, often used by scholars to describe Chos \u014fn-\nMing relations as a whole therefore emerged from Korean rhetorical strategies of negotiation.  \nThe effectiveness of Korean appeals rested on the Chos \u014fn court \u2019s practical savvy about the \nintricate workings of Ming institutions it nurtured by investing in regular envoy missions. Chapter 3 \nunderstands envoy exchange as a channel the Chos \u014fn court could use to influence the dynamics of \nempire. Korean envoy travel to the Ming fostered unofficial, unsanctioned, and often clandestine \n \n 57  relationships between the Chos \u014fn court and Ming officials. These connections allo wed Chos \u014fn to \nacquire information about Ming political developments vital to Chos \u014fn\u2019s decision -making process.  \nWhereas previous chapters discussed how techniques of engagement and representation, \ndynamics of knowledge production, and social connections cam e to constitute empire, Chapter 4, \nargues that these all became resources for appropriation and manipulation. It follows the dramatic \nrise of Prince Suyang who had used diplomacy with the Ming to become the king of Korea (King \nSejo). Although diplomacy was  the exclusive prerogative of the monarch, his representatives could \nappropriate and usurp these functions in practice. As king, he continued to appropriate Ming \nauthority instrumentally, flouting Ming orders and concealing his insubordination through assi duous \nself-representation.  \nSuyang \u2019s reign also saw the emergence of novel techniques of Korean self -representation, \nnamely the Korean compiled anthologies of Chos \u014fn-Ming envoy poetry, the Brilliant Flowers. When \nKorean diplomacy appealed to Ming authority,  it could mitigate unfavorable imperial policies, but it \nalso risked undercutting the Chos \u014fn court \u2019s own claims of cultural and political sovereignty. Chapter \n5 argues that the Brilliant Flowers addressed this particular dilemma. Envoy poetry posed as \ntransparent celebration of imperial grandeur, but through their composition, Chos \u014fn poet -envoys \ncontested empire by clarifying the ideological bases for Ming sovereignty and positing alternative \nnarratives for triangulating the relationships between Chos \u014fn, the Ming, and the imperial tradition. \nChapter 6 address spatial practices of historical self -representation. The Chos \u014fn court used historical \nsites in the city of P \u2019y\u014fngyang related to the legendary Shang Chinese prince Kija, widely credited \nwith bringing ci vilization to Korea, to represent particular narratives of Korea \u2019s history to Ming \nvisitors. Chos \u014fn secured Korean links to the Kija mythos and divested it  of resonances with an \nirredentist view of Korea as lost imperial territory.

The \ndocuments, composed in the ornate style of four -six parallel prose ( \u56db\u516d\u99e2\u6587 ), arrived at the courts \nof the Tang \u5510 (618\u2013907), Liao \u907c (907\u20131125), Northern Song \u5317\u5b8b  (960\u20131127), and Jin \u91d1 \n(1115 \u20131234) emperors. The practice continued through the Mongol -Yuan \u8499\u5143  (1206 \u20131368), the \nMing \u660e (1368 \u20131644), and the Qing \u6e05 (1644\u20131911) periods. These documents provided valuable \nsymbolic capital for these rulers, because imperial discourse treated \u201cpresenting memorials\u201d as a \ngesture of \u201cdeclaring [oneself] a vassal\u201d (Ch. fengbiao chengchen \u5949\u8868\u7a31\u81e3 ), an act of political \nsubmission. Dynastic chronicles described the recognition of imperial legitimacy by foreign rulers \nand local leaders alike in these terms.1  \nThe emperor \u2019s court counted on its officials to provide effusive encomia to its virtue, but it \ncould not control the presentati on of diplomatic missives from polities beyond its rule. Herein lies a \nfundamental tension, one which scholars of \u201ctraditional Chinese foreign relations\u201d have long \npointed out.2 The imperial court desired foreign contact as a demonstration of its  superiori ty, but \nforeign rulers were not always eager to play the role of a political inferior. In theory, memorial \npresentation and submission were inseparable; in practice, the two did not always go hand in hand. \nA so-called memorial of submission from a foreign ruler could intimate rather different notions of \n                                                 \n1 This turn of phrase beings with its usage by Sima Guang in his Zizhi tongjian \u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451  f.72, pp. 2284, 2290; f.1 76, p. \n5483, f.281, p. 9188; f. 283, p. 9242 f.284, 9294, f. 285, p. 9310; f.287, 9364.  \n2 Fairbank, The Chinese World Order , 8, 10 \u201313. \n \n 60  relational hierarchy.

As the Qianlong emperor ( \u4e7e\u9686  r. 1711 \u20131799) famously did for the return of the \nTorghuts to Qing rule, an emperor could deploy the vast cultural apparatus of the imperial state to \nportray the arrival of g uests from afar as \u201csubmission.\u201d4 Moments of interaction with those beyond \nthe pale became a site to proclaim desired relational hierarchies.  \nThe desired gestures of submission required foreign contact, but the volatility of such \nrelations presented a chal lenge to the imperial court.

This mastery of classical Chinese \nmeant that Korean documents were wrought by Korean hands and were not fict ions of imperial \nconceit manufactured by wily translators; thus they appeared to represent genuine sentiment. With a \npaper trail of declaring submission for over a millennium, it seems, as imperial accounts often \nsuggested, that Korea was indeed the empire \u2019s most \u201cloyal vassal state.\u201d12 The apparent \nconfirmation of this long -standing stereotype, however, depends on locating Korean sincerity in \nliterary mastery, a line of reasoning that contains the seeds of its own contradiction. If Korean \ncompetence was ade quate to the symbolic construction of empire, what prevented a Korean author \nfrom manipulating those symbols?  \nRecognition of Korean literary mastery did lead imperial readers to suspect Korean authors \nof such manipulation. The first emperor of the Ming dyn asty, Taizu ( \u660e\u592a\u7956  r. 1368 \u20131398) once \ndescribed a memorial written by Yi Sung \u2019in \u674e\u5d07\u4ec1  (1347 \u20131392) as \u201ccrafted and pointed in \ndiction\u201d(\u8868\u8fad\u7cbe\u5207 ).13 Only a few years later, in 1396, the Ming emperor accused Korean memorial \ndrafters of hiding insults in ornate allusions. Since Ko rean literati mastered the art of composition, \nany perceived flaw in diction or rhyme, not to mention suspicious homophones and miswritten \ncharacters, alerted to possible irreverence.14 The sincerity of Korean memorials hinged on Korean \nliterary mastery, bu t the very same mastery of language enabled subversion.  \n                                      ", "doc_id": "b7823dd0-796b-4c2c-92fe-47f6db49e332", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "5c2c74b99200bc5b07ea142a8bbb96b4b68907524f7c619f5e3d9eba4af3f016", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 214040, "end": 216859}, "relationships": {"1": "f47394fe-94c7-4ac0-a316-a92b37a55a86", "2": "cd8e3ba3-21f2-4847-abba-35fa7c2ccf8b", "3": "e421ce2e-5614-4ecd-b66f-ce22bb807e4c"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "e421ce2e-5614-4ecd-b66f-ce22bb807e4c": {"__data__": {"text": "possible irreverence.14 The sincerity of Korean memorials hinged on Korean \nliterary mastery, bu t the very same mastery of language enabled subversion.  \n                                                 \n12 Clark, \u201cSino -Korean tributary relations,\u201d 273.

What was at work was simply not the s ubversion of petty insults or \ncoded insinuations, but something much more subtle, sophisticated, and powerful. These letters, \ncomposed by Korea \u2019s most talented writers, interfaced with the literary enterprise of empire to insist \non Korea \u2019s prerogative in t he discursive construction of imperial order. In other words, Korean \ncommunications with the imperial court did not so much challenge empire as perform a subtler sort \nof subversion by shaping and guiding it.  \nUnderstanding this process of construction requi res resisting the temptation to read the \nliterary devices of the diplomatic memorial as \u201cmere rhetoric.\u201d Admittedly repetitive use of \nconsistent themes across time in these texts certainly lends to an air of disconnection from the world \nbeyond the text. Ye t, it is precisely this temporal stability and endurance that caution against such a \nreductive view. For if they were ossified gestures, their stakes, shown both in the enormous energies \nKorean courts devoted to composing them and their sensitive reception  by imperial audiences, \nbecome difficult to explain. As Joshua Van Lieu has argued in the only serious treatment of this \ngenre in English to date, the literary devices in these texts possessed an illocutionary force that \nmaintained and reenacted the terms of the relationship. Coined by language theorist J.L. Austin, \nillocutionary force points to the power of a speech -act that moves either the speaker or the audience \nto future action, even if such demands are not made explicit in the grammar or diction of th e \n                                       ", "doc_id": "e421ce2e-5614-4ecd-b66f-ce22bb807e4c", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "9d1e8e15ee0bc0b2e0e21469f14e01b1acd80f4db0028e898d61ce0c901f223a", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 216894, "end": 219667}, "relationships": {"1": "f47394fe-94c7-4ac0-a316-a92b37a55a86", "2": "b7823dd0-796b-4c2c-92fe-47f6db49e332", "3": "a498c4fd-10d9-48c6-bbef-9eee85ecc0d8"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "a498c4fd-10d9-48c6-bbef-9eee85ecc0d8": {"__data__": {"text": "a speech -act that moves either the speaker or the audience \nto future action, even if such demands are not made explicit in the grammar or diction of th e \n                                                 \n15 The Ming Taiz u period case is discussed in Pak W \u014fnho[hyo] \u6734\u5143\u7187 , My\u014fngch\u2019o Chos \u014fn kwan \u2019gyesa y \u014fn\u2019gu, 5\u201327. \n16 T\u2019aejo sillok  14:5b [1398/05a/03#1].  \n \n 64  statement.17 Paeans of empire in these memorials spoke of benevolent rule, literary and civil virtue, \nuniversal sovereignty, and reciprocity not as fanciful description, but as appeals exhorting action \naccording to these principles. This chapter argues th at by investing illoctuionary force in its \nmemorials, the Korean court did not only negotiate with individual imperial regimes. They were \nframing the terms of empire itself.  \nThe endurance of the diplomatic memorial in Korea as both a genre and practice rai ses \nseveral questions. How should this remarkable continuity across dynastic time be understood? \nShould the tropes and rhetorical strategies they employ be read in terms of generic qualities or \nsituated in the specific, historical contexts of their composi tion? As this chapter will show, these \ntexts were in dialogue with both scales of time, situating the moment in relation to the broader \nimperial tradition.  \nFifteenth century Chos \u014fn court compilations preserved Kory \u014f and early Chos \u014fn memorials. \nThey allow an approach to these questions from the perspective of knowledge production. The \nmemorial was both an object of knowledge and a component of knowledge production, a dual \nexistence  that makes explicit the dialogic relationship bet ween the two scales of time. On  the one \nhand, these compilations preserved these memorials as examples of literary and rhetorical expertise \nso they could be consulted in the future. On the other, the memori als themselves produced a \ntimeless image of Korea for imperial consumption.  \nTreating the memorial as an object of knowledge makes salient that two features of the \ngenre, its putative \u201ceternity\u201d and the \u201csincerity\u201d of its expression, were both rhetorical de vices of the \ngenre itself. Its \u201ceternity,\u201d visible in the memorial \u2019s consistent use over a millennium, resonates with \n                                                 \n17 Joshua John Van Lieu, \u201cDivergen t Visions of Serving the Great ,\u201d chapter 2.

It was \nan artifact crafted for the memorial, one element in the grander construct of empire.

For these very reasons, they were the things their \ndrafters most emphasized.  \nDiplomatic Memorials: The Genre  \nBy the Chos \u014fn period, the diplomatic memorial  already had a long histo ry in Korea. After \nthe fifteenth century, whenever Chos \u014fn memorial drafters prepared a new document for an embassy \nto the Ming, they could consult a repertoire of precedents documented in several compilations. \nAlthough superficially similar to Chinese ante cedents , their organization in these compilations \nreveals stark differences from earlier examples. These compilations, as both a reflection of past \npractices and a guide for future ones, granted the Korean memorial a stability of genre and form and \ncodifie d the diplomatic memorial as an object of knowledge.  \nThe Chos \u014fn court and its offices compiled diplomatic memorials as part of other projects. \nThe Chos \u014fn Office of Diplomatic Correspondence18 kept copies of past memorials in the Recorded \n                                                 \n18 S\u016dngmunw \u014fn \u627f\u6587\u9662 . \n \n 66  Notes of the Pagoda Tree Hall (Kwew \u014fn t\u016dngnok \u69d0\u9662\u8b04\u9304 ), a selected collation of the  bureau \u2019s \ndocuments.19 Various dynastic histories provided scattered examples antedating the Chos \u014fn. Court \nofficials gathered these documents in one place when they included them a larger compilation, the \nLiterary Selections of the East (Tongmuns \u014fn \u6771\u6587\u9078 ) in the middle of the fifteenth century.20 This \nanthology also collected a range of other diplomatic epistles, such as official rescripts to imperial \nagencies (as opposed to memorials to the emperor) and personal letters from Korean rulers to \nimperial officials  in addition to p\u2019yomun .

See KWT N f.1 \u20132 for its memorials. Chos \u014fn archival records were \nextensive. Records more detailed that the above, however, do not survive from before the Imjin War. In the wake of the \nJapanese invasion, the Chos \u014fn court abandoned the capital city. When the city \u2019s angry denizens rose up to protest the \ncourt \u2019s departure, they looted the palace and set fire to the archives of many government offices to destroy slave \nregisters. The ensuing urban unrest left the royal palaces, along with the city \u2019s libraries and extensiv e holdings, in \nsmoldering ruins. See S\u014fnjo sillok  26:7a [1592/04/14#28].

They represented the Korean ruler as the master of \nhis own people ( min \u6c11), ancestral shrines ( chongmyo \u5b97\u5edf ) and altars of state and grain ( sajik \u793e\u7a37 ). \nNevertheless, by reserving p\u2019yo for the emperor, Kory \u014f and Chos \u014fn monarchs deferred to Yuan or \nMing rulers as universal, cosmic rulers. This arrangement placed the Korean ruler o n par with \nimperial officials; both were imperial subjects ( sin/chen \u81e3). Korean rulers, by receiving only ch\u014fn \nfrom their own subjects, occupied a position of parity with imperial princes, consistent with their \ntreatment in Ming ritual hierarchy.29  \nHere we  have a tension between two competing and overlapping operative logics. From the \nvantage of the Ming court, Korean memorial presentation was a ritual practice legible to the \nintegrative logic of imperial rule, as it was coherent and compatible with its own  institutions.

The Chos \u014fn and the Ming ruling families never had direct kinship ties, but an institution of \nvirtual k inship remained in force.

Early Kory \u014f period \nmemorials did not always formally distinguish Korean rulers from their erstwhile o verlords, the Liao, \nJin, and Song emperors.31 From the fourteenth century onward, during the period of Mongol \n                                                 \n30 The language is reminiscent of the Zhou period fengjian model (\u5c01\u5efa ), where local powers were de facto states that \nowed their allegiance to the Zhou overlord.  The Ming maintained this rhetoric for its own so -called \u201cfeudal lords\u201d (Ch: \nzhuhou \u8af8\u4faf ) and local princes (Ch: fanwang \u85e9\u738b ), but these emoluments were based on stipends and land grants, not \nindependent fiefs. Chos \u014fn, however, was a state. The symbols of autonomy used here: people, ancestral shrines, and the \naltars to earth and grain,  were the same used for Zhou period local lords. The kings of Chos \u014fn, however, unlike the \nZhou local lords, were never placed in power by the Ming. The description then was always figurative, spoken in simile. \nImagining the Chos \u014fn and the Ming relationship  as a reenactment of the pre -Qin fengjian model was an important trope \nin the diplomatic discourse of the time.

The P\u2019algwanhoe was a Buddhist religious celebration closely connected to expressions of Kory \u014f royal \nsovereignty. These ceremonies had occurred in periods when Kory \u014f rulers saw thems elves as sovereign rulers of a \nlocalized \u201call -under -heaven\u201d ( ch\u2019\u014fnha) in Korea, unfettered by an imperial suzerain.

The \ninstitutional parallels that emerged of which the use (of the  memorial is only one example) fostered \nlegibility between Korean and imperial practices, but it also meant Korean claim s of authority were \nalways in implicit contest with imperial ones. The avoidance of obvious affronts to imperial claims, \nsuch as the use of a separate calendar, illustrates the delicateness of diplomatic representation. That \nKorean rulers and their officia ls tailored their correspondences in this manner demands \nacknowledging the strong possibility for deliberate representation in such political performances and \ncautions against reading them simply as genuine expressions of some general truth about the natur e \nof Chos \u014fn-Ming relations. Diplomatic memorials, p\u2019yomun , cannot be taken literally as transparent \n\u201cdocuments of expression.\u201d  \nThe crux of the matter is a tension between competing sovereign claims. How does the \ndiplomatic memorial manage this tension? Add ressing this question requires examining the \ndiplomatic memorial as a genre diachronically. The memorial bound Korea to the imperial tradition, \nand so its history must be understood in conjunction with the history of empire.  \nA Genealogy of Empire  \nCompilati ons like the Literary Selections of the East gave diplomatic memorials a generic \ncoherence, constructed through their accumulation of tangible examples. Their compilers \ntransformed a repository of inert documents by bringing them together collectively as a  device of \nknowledge.

At the outset, it was a result of a \nselective rendering of a genre. Its compilers had culled a particular set of documents from extant \nmaterials.

The use of the p\u2019yo-memorial in diplomacy was no \nexception. The majority of the extant documents date from the Kory \u014f period, though a significant \nportion are from after the Mongol invasions.47 The pre -Mongol memorials addressed the Liao, Jin, \nand Song courts, who all claimed to be legitimate successors of the Tang \u2019s once unified empire by \nadapting and reinventing its ri tual and rhetorical technologies in the process.48 Rival claimants to \nunified empire competed for Kory \u014f\u2019s recognition.

Korean envoys bearing these missives arriv ed at least annually to the Liao \nand Jin courts, but their presence in the Song was a rare cause for celebration. The reign of Emperor \nHuizong ( \u5fbd\u5b97  r. 1100 \u20131126) saw a flurry of renewed diplomatic activity with Kory \u014f.

The actual Kory\u014f letter thanking Huizong for this gift of music differed in \nessential ways from the Song mock memorial, matching neither its structure nor its rhetorical flow. \nInstead of humble barbarians prof essing their ignorance in the face of the civilizing imperial \nknowledge of Song, we find the following:  \nYour Servant has heard that when Xuanyuan [the Yellow Thearch, Huangdi] created the Xianchi and \nYu [the Sage King] completed the Daxia , they used their own body for their measures and forged \ntripods to test their sounds.62 Before the Zhou, all followed their rules. [Those] from the Han on \nfailed in their transmission. The [corrupt sounds] of the Zheng and Wei burgeoned, and the Airs and \nElegantiae  [i.e. th e proper music of the  Book of Songs ] were long broken.63 The various scholars could \nnot construct them, and the generations that followed could not develop them. [But] the Way was not \nenacted in vain, and Principle had something to it. Now, Your Majesty the  Emperor, wise and sagely, \nbrilliant through sincerity, took up the remonstrance of recluses, absolved the confusion of \nmeasurements, and followed the legacy of the ancient kings. And so, [You] achieved the balance of \nthe Yellow Bell,64 adorning it with the  five modes, disseminating it in the eight instruments. \nPromulgating them in the altars and shrines, the various spirits submit; and proclaiming them in the \nimperial court, the commoners and officials are harmonious. [With this you] illuminated the \nachieve ments of an age, and revived the fallen paragons of antiquity.65 \n \nThe Kory\u014f letter exhibited a mastery of classical diction and rhymeprose equal to that of the Song \ncourt composer. This mastery allowed the Kory\u014f to represent its own interpretation of the \nDashengyue as a project of cultural revival. No less an encomium t o imperial virtue,  praises of \nHuizong for matching the achievements of sage rulers show that the Kory\u014f recipient could \nappreciate as a connoisseur and not as a mere consumer.

The question remains \nwhether such orchestrations occurred at the behest of the imperial court or if Kory\u014f had responded \nto the Song on its own terms. Behind these issues is a tension fundamental to this genre.

The intended audience of these \nexemplary exam answers was not likely the Kory\u014f court. Thousands of leagues away, the Kory\u014f \nproduced a memorial with stark deviations from Song expectations. Furthermore, Kory\u014f court \ncomposers had their own model s to consult. During this period, Kory\u014f \u2019s court composers had \nalready honed their rhetorical craft in their dealings with the Liao court. By Huizong \u2019s reign, the \nSong were interlopers in a preexisting tradition, one that for over a century the Kory\u014f had \ndeveloped with the Liao without Song participation.  \nKorean memorial writers anticipated the imperial gaze, ever cognizant of the symbolic value \nthese memorial presentations had for the imperial court. Emperors expressed their displeasure, if a \nKorean memoria l did not somehow fit their expectations. S\u014f K\u014fj\u014fng noted, for example, a Jin \nemperor who thought that a classical allusion in a Kory\u014f memorial had insinuated the less -than-\nglorious way in which he came to the throne.70 Yuan regulations prohibited certain w ords from such \nmemorials.

While Ming Taizu had tried to enforce literary style, the bloodshed around these events is exaggerated. \nChan, however, neglects and misreads the Korean evidenc e surrounding the affair.

At the very least, their inclusion in a literary canon signifies their \nimportance for a fifteenth -century Korean world -view that has yet to be properly appreciated. This \nmonu mental task is beyond the scope of this chapter; what instead follows is a deconstruction of \ntwo central rhetorical tropes in all these memorials: sincerity \u2014that Koreans were genuinely loyal to \nthe empire, and eternity \u2014that they would always be so.  \nConstr ucting Authenticity: Sincerity and the Imperializing Mode  \nAt the Ming court, the symbolic significance of the Korean memorials depended on their \nsincerity. The Ming court mandated the presentation of congratulatory memorials ( hebiao \u8cc0\u8868 ) \nfrom its officials for imperial birthdays and other important occasions. They could not have directly \ncoerced foreign groups, such as the Koreans, Vietnamese, Ry\u016bky\u016bans and the like, to do so.80 For \none winter solstice in 1543, the Ming Jiajing emperor ( \u5609\u9756  1521 \u20131567) expresse d his dismay that \nvery few foreign rulers sent their felicitations.

In a ritualized context, what authenticated these sentiments was the regularity and \nconsistency of their performance. In other words, the reliability of performance was in itself a \ndemonst ration of its sincerity. Therefore, that a particular sentiment was deliberately performed did \nnot necessarily gainsay its authenticity. Moreover, the transformative power ascribed to ritual \nperformance in premodern East Asian ritual thinking meant that re peated demonstration on its own \nhad the potential to alter even disingenuous sentiments. Ritual was supposed to be performative , in \nthat the repeated performance of sentiments also transformed the performer.  \nHowever, this also means those who performed ri tuals were also aware of their performative \npower and could use them strategically. Repeated performance of ritual, then, could be the very \nmechanism the performer used to show his audience that he had indeed been transformed in the \nmanner desired by his a udience.82 The literary and ritual demonstration of sincerity in the diplomatic \nmemorial itself could thus be a site of potential intercession. Korean diplomats and memorial writers \nused a rhetoric of sentimental authenticity and performed ritual consistenc y to construct sincerity as \na central tenet of Korean diplomacy for an imperial audience. In doing so, they brought their \ngestures of sincere submission into a moral economy of empire that exhorted imperial action in \nterms of principled obligations.  \nMemori als invariably assumed the voice of the Korean ruler. As missives from the Korean \nking to the emperor, these documents were to express the authentic sentiments of an embodied \nsovereignty: kingship personified as an incarnation of a state and its people. Th e irony was that it \nwas always a fictive, disembodied royal voice.

My gratitude to Theodore Hughes for this insight.  \n \n 88  task of fashioning his royal voice for the imperial ear fell on his court composers. Whereas historical \nrecords rarely include names of memorial drafters, treating them as state level communications, both \nthe Literary Selections of the East and the Recorded Notes of the Pagoda Tree Hall ascribe authorship to \nspecific individuals.83 These included the foremost literary officials of the day. From the period of \nthe Mongol invasions until the early 1400s, memorial writers included figures such as Yi Kyubo \u674e\n\u594e\u5831  (1168 \u20131241), Kim Ku \u91d1\u5775  (1211 \u20131278), Yi Chehy\u014fn \u674e\u9f4a\u8ce2  (1297 \u20131367), Yi Kok \u674e\u6996  \n(1298 \u20131351) and his son Yi Saek \u674e\u7a61  (1328 \u20131396), Yi Sung \u2019in \u674e\u5d07\u4ec1  (1347\u20131392), Ch\u014fng \nToj\u014fn \u912d\u9053\u50b3  (1342 -1398), and Kw\u014fn K\u016dn \u6b0a\u8fd1  (1352 \u20131409), each of whom was a significant \nliterary and political figure of his day.84 \nThe writers listed above were certainly involved in crafting these memorials, but \nwordsmithing was only one step  in a longer chain of production. Any one diplomatic memorial \npassed through many hands before a final version was approved for delivery. Chos\u014fn institutional \ntexts describe an extensive review process.85 Differing versions of the same memorial in different  \nsources suggest an extensive process of drafting and revision, confirmed also by such discussions in \n                                                 \n83 Later compilers of liter ary collections of individual authors ( munjip \u6587\u96c6 ) likely benefited from attributions in the \nTMS and KWTN. These literary collections sometimes postdating the composition of these documents by centuries, \nincluded official correspondence as personal writings . For example, Kim Ku \u2019s literary collection, the Chip\u2019o chip was first \ncompiled only in the 19th century. It drew extensively from the TMS and included diplomatic memorials ascribed to \nKim.  \n84 For instance, Yi Kok and his son Yi Saek not only passed the munkwa exams in Korea, but became degree holders in \nthe Yuan as well. Yi Kok had passed the regional examinations in 1333, while Yi Saek had participated and passed the \nmetropolitan exams in Dadu in 1354.

By the early \nChos\u014fn, many memorial writers enjoyed the position of literary adjudicator ( munhy \u014fng \u6587\u8861 ), an informal designation for \na civil officials who concomitantly held the highest positions in the Hall of Assembled Worthies ( \u96c6\u8ce2\u6bbf ), Office of \nSpecial Counselors ( \u5f18\u6587\u9928 ), and the Office of Literary Arts ( \u85dd\u6587\u9928 ). During this period, they emerged from a narrow \ncourt elite, bound together by kinship and scholarly community.

The Chos\u014fn court \nreplied, undoubtedly to protect Ch\u014fng, that the memorial was in fact wrought by several other \nofficials. As the affair escalated, functionaries, scribes, and other Chos\u014fn officials came to be \nimplicated.87 Since authorsh ip was not always clear, responsibility was likewise diffused. Authorship \nwas thus in the end just as much as a manufactured effect as the document \u2019s disembodied sovereign \nvoice. Together they occluded an entire institutional complex behind their productio n. \nDrafting the text of the memorial was only the first step in preparation. The materiality of \nthe text was equally important and obeyed set conventions by the fifteenth century. The memorial \nwould be written on specially prepared \u201cmemorial paper\u201d ( \u7b8b\u7d19 ).

By the Jiajing reign, Korean memorial paper came to be quite valued. Later \nthe Ming painter and calligrapher Dong Qichang \u8463\u5176\u660c  took a special liking for Korean memorial paper. He evidently \npurloined memorials of this sort stored in the imperial archives, and after washing off the ink bearing these royal \nmissives, he used them for his own a rtwork. The red cinnabar -based oils used for seal imprints, however, were not water \nsoluble. For this reason, several of Dong Qichang \u2019s works still bear the mark of the Chos \u014fn king, though the original \nwriting is barely visible.

The i nsistence on sincerity in these documents may have indeed mirrored actual \nsentiments in certain instances, but it was also a rhetorical tactic of the Korean memorial writer.  \nThe diplomatic memorial was forged precisely in a context where sincerity could no t be \ntaken for granted. In a period of political fragmentation, the Kory\u014f treated the Liao, Song, and Jin in \nturn (and often simultaneously) as universal sovereigns. When the Mongol invasions devastated \nnortheast Asia in the early thirteenth century, the K ory\u014f court again used diplomacy to make peace \nwith the ascendant Mongol empire. A lasting peace eluded both parties; harsh Mongol terms proved \nunacceptable to the Kory\u014f court, which reneged on earlier agreements once Mongol troops \nwithdrew. When the Kory\u014f offered submission to stave off Mongol aggression in 1238, the Mongols \nquestioned the sincerity of Kory\u014f \u2019s overture.94 \nThese suspicions were well placed . The Kory\u014f court was not ready to capitulate. In 1233, it \nhad sent an envoy bearing a memorial to the Ju rchen Jin court in Kaifeng. The Kory\u014f hoped that a \nrekindled alliance with the Jin could be a basis for resisting the Mongols. Its drafter, Yi Kyubo, \ndescribed the Jin emperor as universal ruler of the cosmos, whose virtue brought peace to the world. \nThe M ongols, on the other hand, were \u201cbrutes and barbarians\u201d ( \u7377\u4fd7 ) so \u201cinsolent as to have \nforced the displacement of the imperial realm,\u201d an allusion to Jin court \u2019s exile to the south. Yi \nshowed the sincerity of the Kory\u014f king through tears that \u201cflowed down in  torrents\u201d upon \nwitnessing the \u201caccumulated piles of [Jin] imperial letters.\u201d The emissary bearing the letter, however, \n                                                 \n94 For an overview of the Kory \u014f-Mongol wars, see Willia m E.

The Mongols had began their final assault on the Jin \u2019s last strongholds, \ndestroying it a year later.95 \nOnly four years later, Yi Kyubo found himself arguing for the sincerity of Kory\u014f \u2019s allegiance \nto the very \u201cbrutes and barbarians\u201d of the 1234 Jin letter. The eternal commitment to the Jin \nnotwithstanding, Yi Kyubo transferred the same effusive adulations once r eserved to the Jin to the \nMongols in his 1238 diplomatic memorial to their ruler Ogodei Khan (r. 1229 \u20131241). In this appeal, \nhe deflected Mongol accusations of insincerity:  \nYour magnanimity that understands forthrightness has been laid bare to us....Humbly  yours, this \nservant dwells afar in the barren marches and improperly occupies a humble fief. And so, this ignoble, \nsmall country would need to depend on a Great State. Still more, the Sage that we have been \nexpecting has just descended. As one among the v assals who hold on to their lands, how dare we not \nsubmit with sincerity?96 \n \nThe Mongols suspected Kory\u014f of submitting only for necessity \u2019s sake, a way to avert an existential \nthreat. Yi Kyubo transformed this existential necessity into a compulsion of duty , an ethical \nnecessity. Kory\u014f had no choice but to be sincere in submission. It submitted not out of fear , but \nbecause recognizing the inevitability of the Mongol \u2019s imperial destiny was its moral obligation:  \n....How could one say that \u201cthis was taken out o f necessity when the situation became difficult?\u201d \nThough we are sincere, we have been doubted, and on the contrary elicited chastisement from our \nRuler and Father, and so [You] have repeatedly sent armies to punish these transgressions. 97  \n \nAlthough as \u201cru ler and father,\u201d the emperor always reserved the right to \u201cpunish these \ntransgressions,\u201d Kory\u014f \u2019s sincerity meant the chastisement was unjust.

With our old customs \npreserv ed, though our tribute of seas and mountains (i.e. local produce) is meager, how could we miss \na single year? This is not only something for today, but something [we will fulfill] eternally .98 \n  \nThe assertion of sincerity and the declaration of fealty were tokens of negotiation, a way to express \nKory\u014f terms of peace to demand the cessation of war. At the same time, it also appealed to a vision \nof moral empire; Kory\u014f demands of the Mongols were not made explicitly, but couched within the \nrhetorical logic of t he document. Its appeals rested on assumptions about the moral prerogatives of \nthe emperor; in portraying his motivations and his magnanimity in this way, the Kory\u014f memorial did \nnot seek an accurate depiction of who the Mongol ruler was, but a clear image of who he should be. \nPerforming sincerity, through literary embellishment and the promise of tribute, was a political \nstrategy.99  \nDeclarations of sincere loyalty worked within the warp and woof of a broader rhetorical \nstructure, in which ideals of empire were erected from claims of sentimental authenticity. The \nmemorial asserted sincerity, foundational as it was to this construction, often at times when it was \nmost suspect.

Although this diplomatic \nmemorial was addressed the the Mongol emperor, the true audience for its appeal was not the illiterate Mongol ruler \nOgodei, but the former Jin minister Yel\u00fc Chucai who had managed the newly conquered lands of northern Chi na for his \nMongol overlords. Yel\u00fc had obliquely voiced his suspicions over the sincerity of Kory \u014f\u2019s professed surrender to its \nenvoys. Perhaps more so than any other member of the Mongol court, Yel\u00fc was cognizant of Kory \u014f\u2019s diplomatic \nstrategy, given Kory \u014f\u2019s history of interaction with the Jin court he once served. This instance would not be the only, or \nthe last, where seeming ease with how Koreans seemed to shift their loyalties from one imperial claimant to another \nbecame a source of distrust.

The munificence of the emperor, once expressed in the infinity of his \nvirtue, power, and glory was transformed into an instrument of reciprocity. This image of the \n\u201ccalling deer\u201d rephrased the political implications of Kory\u014f \u2019s acquiescence. Not simply an \nexpression of fealty, it also claimed for Kory\u014f a dignified and important place as authenticator of \nand participant in the project of empire. In the logic of the diplomatic m emorial, it is the vassal who \nmade the ruler.  \nPortraying acquiescence to imperial sovereignty in terms of reciprocal relations between lord \nand vassal was a persistent trope in Korean diplomatic writing. Its iteration in the mid -thirteenth \ncentury was sign ificant because it implicitly challenged the ideological principles that guided the \nMongol wars of conquest, at least before the the fragmentation of the Mongol empire during the \nreign o f Khubilai Khan. The desperate and drawn out war between Kory\u014f and the Mongols resulted \npartly from divergent expectations of the Kory\u014f court and the Mongols.

In the case of the Jin and Mongol letters, it was precisely their will to \ntimelessness \u2014the apparently ahistorical vision of empire \u2014that in fact imbued them with their \nrhetorical power. The Kory\u014f articulated Mongol rulers hip within the ethos and modality of imperial \nrule that it had once granted the Liao and Jin emperors. They did this even before the Mongol \nleadership had aspired to those ideas or accepted the imperial tradition as their own. Kory\u014f, by \nengaging with the M ongols on the same terms and in the same mode as it had done with past \nempires, attempted to revive an imperial tradition that had been extinguished with the Jin \u2019s \ndestruction.109 In other words, the Kory\u014f memorial did not simply legitimate Mongol claims to \nimperial authority. By acknowledging these claims even before the Mongols made them for \nthemselves, it attempted to fashion the very terms on which imperial authority was based by \npreemptively situating Kory\u014f within an established tradition of empire.  \nRelated to this effort to impose the imperial tradition on Mongol rulers, these Kory\u014f letters \nand diplomatic dispatches also fostered a sense of cultural recognition among the Confucian officials \nat the Yuan court. This recognition enabled a site of political intercourse that remained productive \nthrough the end of the Yuan period. For example, Kim Ku, with the dispatches he wrote from 1260 \nuntil his death in 1274, earned the praise of Wang E ( \u738b\u9d9a  1190 \u20131273), a former Jin optimus  \nresponsible for reviving imperial  rituals at the Mongol court.110 Mutual cultural identification \nbetween former Jin officials in Mongol service and the Kory\u014f provided a requisite discursive space \nfor casting Kory\u014f \u2019s preservation as integral to", "doc_id": "4904d697-5e58-4725-964c-135664cd4b8e", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "b8ef90d59b7072b79a228cd905f8af3bf8a12cf5bdb4fc55fa91407124371938", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 318910, "end": 321914}, "relationships": {"1": "f47394fe-94c7-4ac0-a316-a92b37a55a86", "2": "1b67c868-8f08-44be-a707-e89c4f57218a", "3": "a85e7bf7-d951-4e76-beab-6fbaa97809cb"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "a85e7bf7-d951-4e76-beab-6fbaa97809cb": {"__data__": {"text": " 1190 \u20131273), a former Jin optimus  \nresponsible for reviving imperial  rituals at the Mongol court.110 Mutual cultural identification \nbetween former Jin officials in Mongol service and the Kory\u014f provided a requisite discursive space \nfor casting Kory\u014f \u2019s preservation as integral to imperial restoration and cultural revival.

This reminder implored the emperor \nand his servants to stay true to their word. Given the tenuousness of Mongol -Kory\u014f relations, \npoisoned by decades of warfare, neither Khubilai \u2019s promises of Kory\u014f \u2019s preservation nor Kory\u014f \u2019s \nown declarations of loyalty were taken for granted. When this atmosphere of mistrust hung \noverhead, statements guaranteeing Kory\u014f \u201ceternal\u201d status as a \u201cvassal\u201d amounted to little. The \nKory\u014f letter thus quoted Khubilai \u2019s original edict:  \n\u2018If you set straight your territory and boundaries and settle the hearts of your people, then my armies \nwill not come ever again. Now that I have made such a declaration, I will ce rtainly not eat my words. \u2019 \nA great declaration thus made; the utmost benevolence can be seen.

The preservation of the kingdom of Kory\u014f was no longer a reprieve from inevitable \ndestruction or a precarious survival scrounged from the emperor \u2019s pleasure, but a matter of duty: \nKory\u014f \u2019s duty to the emperor . The perpetuity of Kory\u014f rule became the m echanism for repaying the \nemperor. Kory\u014f, once a territory to be conquered, had integrated its preservation into the logic of \nimperial rule.  \nAsserting such promises in one memorial did not guarantee the interests of the Kory\u014f \nmonarchy. Conquering regimes tend to forget their promises, especially to those who cannot resist \nthem, and the terms of this relationship had to be repeatedly reasserted. The wording of Khubilai \u2019s \nedicts, as it is interpreted in this memorial, came to be deployed repeatedly throughou t the late \nKory\u014f to defend the kingdom \u2019s territorial integrity, the well -being of its monarchs, and the sanctity \nof its customs. Part of affirming this relationship was reiterating Kory\u014f \u2019s commitment to Khubilai \u2019s \nimperial project.118 For the Kory\u014f, and late r the Chos\u014fn, repeated assertions of consistent tropes \nwas not simply reiterations of preexisting constants, but the transformation of political arrangements \nforged in one historical moment into normative constants to be leveraged in the future.119 \n                                                 \n117 KS version:", "doc_id": "1bd2ed69-655c-4c1b-8602-dae889414c1e", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "dda5455ce0566b33223cf89c8dedf85f6426c3b3d294a71014c0697916dbba3d", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 331833, "end": 334038}, "relationships": {"1": "f47394fe-94c7-4ac0-a316-a92b37a55a86", "2": "960124df-acc6-4a29-b2ee-c6c8cdccf00d", "3": "de629762-c317-41a0-b8ef-d3efc885cc77"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "de629762-c317-41a0-b8ef-d3efc885cc77": {"__data__": {"text": "\nforged in one historical moment into normative constants to be leveraged in the future.119 \n                                                 \n117 KS version: \u81ea\u5c0f\u81e3\u7ddc\u53ca\u65bc\u5f8c\u5b6b\u4ee5\u6b7b\u7232\u5831 ... \u81e3\u8b39\u7576\u5c71\u6d77\u5be7\u8b8a\u6052\u8f38\u4efb\u571f\u4e4b\u8654 . \n118 Yi Ikchu [Lee Ik Joo] \uc774\uc775\uc8fc , \u201cKory \u014f, W\u014fn kwan \u2019gye \u016di kujo e taehan y \u014fn\u2019gu- sowi \u2018Sejo kuj e\u2019 \u016di puns \u014fk \u016dl \nchungsim \u016dro\u201d \uace0\ub824  , \uc6d0\uad00\uacc4\uc758  \uad6c\uc870\uc5d0  \ub300\ud55c  \uc5f0\uad6c  - \uc18c\uc704  \u2018 \uc138\uc870\uad6c\uc81c  \u2018 \uc758 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744  \uc911\uc2ec\uc73c\ub85c  -, Han\u2019guk \nsaron 36 (1996): 1 \u201351. \n119 These issues are discussed further in chapter 2.  \n \n 103  Diplomati c memorials constructed eternity in content, form and practice. The genre \u2019s stable \npersistence through time echoed with a rhetoric of timelessness reaching both backward to the sage \nkings of yore and forwards to an infinite future. These documents project a vision of empire that \ntranscended the political exigencies of the moment and the finite scale of mortal time. This \ntimelessness helped construct both imperial legitimacy and the legitimacy of Korea \u2019s relationship \nwith empire. Timelessness, then, equated imperial authority with cosmic ontology, and thus \nnaturalized its political power.  \nOn the other hand, diplomatic documents were invariably framed within the scale of dynastic \ntime. For Koreans, how imperial time was inscribed had symbolic significance for  the recognition of \nimperial legitimacy, as JaHyun Kim Haboush has shown. For the imperial audience of Korean \ndocuments, evidence of \u201cobserving the proper lunation\u201d ( \u5c0a\u6b63\u6714 ), i.e. following the imperial \ncalendar, was an important symbol of Korean sincerity. Mongol -Yuan officials wanted to make sure \nthe Kory\u014f did not observe Song lunations upon its surrender. A Ming loyalist was moved to tears \nwhen he read Korean books tha t marked time with the Ming calendar. A Qing emperor was miffed \nwhen he discovered that Koreans still observer Ming reign eras. For all of them, the observation of \nspecific dynastic time demonstrated political fealty.120 \nLoyalty belonged to dynastic time, bu t the memorial genre itself transcended it. These two \ntemporal scales were in tension. Korea \u2019s relationship with empire was couched in a rhetoric of \neternity that implied its values and political arrangements existed beyond dynastic time. Yet, empire \nitself was temporally inscribed and circumscribed, a momentary manifestation of an immanent moral \norder.

Or, was it one firmly located within the institu tional structures of one particular \ndynastic state? In other words, did the Korean memorial declare its loyalty to a particular emperor, a \nparticular state, and a particular ruling family, or as an affirmation of the imperial system and its \ntradition as a whole?  \nIf one, as many scholars have done, understands Korean relations with \u201cChina\u201d in terms of a \ntransdynastic ordering of East Asian states with the \u201cChinese\u201d empire at the center of a spatial \nimagination and its ruler the apex of a hierarchy of monarc hs (i.e. the tributary system), then the \nanswer should be the latter. The Korean memorial, then, by configuring dynastic time in a cosmic \nscale, effectively elevated spatial and temporal rulership into something transcendent and universal. \nThese memorials were thus producing a sense of an eternal, transdynastic order within dynastic time.  \nFollowing this line of reasoning in historical analysis, however, risks mistaking the rhetorical \nconstruction of eternity in such texts for unadulterated reality. The \u201ctri butary system\u201d appears as a \nconsistent structural feature only because those who made use of its practices willed it to be so. The \nstrategy in this chapter, and throughout this dissertation then, is to posit an alternative ways of \nthinking about these memo rials and other diplomatic genres. Although these practices took on an \napparent fixity of form, they were in fact sites for contestation and negotiation. Genres of imperial \nlegitimation on the surface, the Korean diplomat and memorial writer participated i n the production \nof empire to shape and ultimately define imperial authority. The memorial was not a reflection of \nthe \u201ctributary system,\u201d but a central process through which such structures were recreated and \nreproduced. The sense of stability then is an illusion sustained by numerous discrete acts of \ncontestation and rewriting.

S\u014f K\u014fj\u014fng \u2019s Literary Selections provided ready models for fu ture composers. A cursory \nexamination of these letters in the Ming and Qing period exhibit a remarkable stylistic and rhetorical \nconsistency. When the Chos\u014fn court official Sin Yong \u2019gae (\u7533\u7528\u6f11  1463\u20131519) compiled a \ncontinuation of S\u014f \u2019s anthology, he did not include  any new diplomatic memorials. In contrast to S\u014f \nand his collaborators who devoted nearly a dozen fascicles to the genre, Sin \u2019s compilation included \nonly two mock memorials, written by Chos\u014fn literati in the voice of imperial officials.121 The \nexclusi on of diplomatic memorials did not indicate a decline in the importance of relations with the \nimperium. Sin Yong \u2019gae active in diplomacy with the Ming, the reign of King Chungjong during \nwhich he made his career, was one of the most active periods of Chos\u014f n-Ming diplomacy.

Aware of Korean \nmisgivings about Manchu legitimacy, the Qing was concerned that the Chos\u014fn might slip in \nreferences to its \u201cbarbaric\u201d origins. A Chos\u014fn memorial included the controversial character i/yi \u5937. \nThere were a wide -range  of possible meanings.

Attempts at regulating their form and diction did not \nfundamentally alter the performative and rhetorical operation of these memorials. Ming and Qing \nemperors alike were dealing with an institutional practi ce that alre ady had a long history and a \nprescribed role in diplomatic interchange.

Herein lies the inherent tension of such lett ers: meaningful only if \nproduced from the outside, and yet acceptable only if they matched the expectations of the imperial \nreader.  \nFor this process to work, diplomatic practices such as memorial writing had to be legible to \nboth parties and read in terms  of a common history. This tension between Korean strategy and \nimperial expectation in turn produces a dialectic relationship between practice and normativity. They \nnavigated the expectations of an audience attuned to established norms, and yet were in the mselves \npart of the process of shaping those norms. What a diplomatic memorial was supposed to be then, \nwas something that was not entirely the product of either imperial conceit or  Korean diplomatic \npractice. The formulaic reproduction of this imperial fi ction in these texts was thus not an outright \nimposition by any imperial court, but a result of co -construction that occurred over many \ngenerations. Consistent and repetitive, this seemingly monolithic genre surely reflected continuity \nthat was a product o f a dialectial process with shifting equilibriums.

Now, he had to correct his earlier policies or \nrisk falling short of the standards of virtue expect ed of him.4 When the memorial returned to the \nextradiegetic mode, it returned to condemning the rebels. In this manner, the Kory\u014f censured past \nMongol policy without having to speak any words of criticism. Thus, the memorial appealed for \nimperial sympathy and clemency , while indicting the empire \u2019s policies in the same stroke. The trick, \nthen, was to challenge imperial authority without appearing to challenge it at all.  \nThe combination of subtle audacity and rhetorical forcefulness here was rare, even in the \nhighly craf ted genre of the diplomatic memorial. The fundamental, underlying rhetorical logic of \nappealing to ideals of empire to challenge empire, nevertheless, was fairly typical of the genre. To \nstrengthen their case, such memorials often cited existing documents,  usually edicts or past \ncorrespondences, to establish precedents as a basis for argumentation. For instance, a memorial, \ndrafted by the same Kory\u014f official, Kim Ku, in 1268 appealed to imperial majesty while expressing \nincredulity that the empire could fal l short of those standards. Kim wrote this letter on behalf of the \n                                                 \n4 The existential threat th e Mongol empire posed to the Kory \u014f created a political urgency that required them, but these \nappeals to imperial clemency were not targeted at an imperial audience per se, but the Han Chinese officials who shared \nan interest with the Kory \u014f in remodeling Ku blai Khan as a Chinese emperor, beholden to the all the ritual, moral and \ninstit utional obligations it implied.  \n \n 110  Kory\u014f to Kublai Khan in order explain Kory\u014f reluctance to provide soldiers and provisions for the \ninvasion of Japan.5 In this letter, the initial encomium of imperial perfection sets up an appeal to the \nemperor \u2019s preternatural ability (and duty) to hear out his subject. The emperor \u2019s unrealistic demands \non Kory\u014f is portrayed to contravene his original intentions. Kim then cites verbatim Kublai \u2019s earlier \nassurances to Kory\u014f, and the very imag e of imperial virtue is fashioned for the ruler against him. \nThat Kory\u014f dared resist the emperor \u2019s requests emerged not from recalcitrance, but from an \ninconsistency between the emperor \u2019s original intentions and his new orders. But because the Kory\u014f \nwas as sured of the Mongol ruler \u2019s wisdom and sympathy, it had no reason to shirk from candid \nexpression.

As both a description and an injunction, this \nterm enshrined principles of reciprocit y that created the necessary discursive space for Kory\u014f to talk \nof what the imperial court should do.8 The task of imperial rule, in Kory\u014f terms, was neither \nconquest nor exploitation. Instead, it was to civilize the world through the power of literary and  civil \ninfluence, i.e. wen (\u6587), and to show its magnanimity in the \u201cpreservation of local customs\u201d ( \u4e0d\u6539\u571f\n\u98a8).9 Empire is defanged in the first instance and Korea \u2019s continued independence guaranteed in \nthe latter. When Korean emissaries exalted the majesty and  asserted the infallibility of empire, they \ndid not simply legitimize power, but sought to constrain it within a framework so as to guide its \noperation. The discourse of empire in these appeals thus provided a tangible of moral standards \nthrough which spec ific policies could be critiqued, without overtly posing as a challenge to the \ninstitution of empire. These representations of the core topoi of moral empire idealized imperial \npower in order to encode what an emperor and his empire should do. \nKorean diplo matic writing often mirrored the phraseologies of imperial authority.  Indeed, \nthey often referenced the same classical authorities and utilized the same turns of phrase, but what is \nclear is that they do not say the same thing with the same words . This cha pter continues the discussion \nKorean diplomatic writing into Chos\u014fn -Ming period.

Korean memorial writers no longer had to face down the threat of an imperial \narmy, but they had to deal with the uncertain whims of Ming bureaucrats, both petty and grand. In \nthe process, high -imperial discourse left the confines of formal memorials and seeped into other \nregisters of diplomatic exchange, and finding its way into informal letters delivered to Ming officials \nand interper sonal interactions. In a process akin to what some anthropologists have called, \n\u201centextualization,\u201d a particular turn of phrase becomes \u201cdetachable from [its] immediate context of \nemission\u201d and is \u201cmade available for repetition or recreation in other conte xts.\u201d In the case of \nKorean diplomacy, the movement is from one type of written text to another, not between different \noral contexts, but the quality of detachability remains the same. Key phrases and idioms from the \nformal memorial was now appropriated an d \u201cre -embedded in a new context.\u201d For these reasons, \nChos\u014fn diplomatic communications  across genres  resemble one another, for they make use of \nsimilar rhetorical techniques and tropes.

For this, we must first examine the kinds of cultural work such discourses \nperformed. We must also recognize reification only occurred after a di stillation from a broader range \nof potential interpretations and imaginations. What could constitute empire was not a fixed and \nconstant formula. Certainly aspects of the imperial tradition, such as principles of hierarchy, the \nimportance of the civilizing  process, and a political imaginary rooted in succession, remained \ncommon features across time. How these different dimensions were imagined in conjunction with \none another and how they manifested in the institutions and policies that shaped the structure of \nrelations with Korea could vary greatly. Reifying empire then was less about reinforcing imperial \npower, but a particular form of it, a way to select one manifestation of empire from a wide range of \npossibilities.  \nThe reason these diplomatic appeals wer e so consistent in rhetoric I argue was because they \nperfor med a common task. They all had to create and maintain a coherent picture of Chos\u014fn \nKorea \u2019s proper relationship with empire for Ming eyes. These regularized, if not stereotyped, \nportrayals were to ensure that Korean embassies received consistent treatment at the hands of the \nMing bureaucracy, whose views and policies were in fact wildly inconsistent.

Chos\u014fn could just as easily be seen as \nbarbaric or civilized.26 At the root of the two views were fundamentally different ways of imagining \nthe role of empire in t he civilizing process and its relationship to political sovereignty.  \nFrom the Korean perspective, being \u201cbarbarian\u201d was not desirable, as both Kory\u014f and \nChos\u014fn elites prided themselves on the Korean ability to \u201cuse Chinese ways to transform the \nbarbarian\u201d (yongha py\u014fni/ yongxia bianyi \u7528\u590f\u8b8a\u5937 ).27 In early Chos\u014fn, this political and social reform \nprogram, often called the \u201cConfucian transformation\u201d of Korea implemented a state -centered \ncivilizing program that fashioned Chos\u014fn sovereignty. This process not only i nvolved Neo -\nConfucian social reforms, but also the creation of a comprehensive institutional and ritual system \nwith based on interpretations of early Chinese classics and, occasionally, contemporary Ming \nmodels.28 The Chos\u014fn sought to demonstrate that their  \u201critual, music, cul ture and artifacts are on \npar with  that of the Central Efflorescence\u201d ( \u4f94\u64ec\u4e2d\u83ef ).

The worst case scenario would be to be seen as barbarians who, by \nadopting imperial institutions, both demonstrated amenability to imperial rule and encroached on its \nprerogatives; the Cho s\u014fn wanted to be both autonomous and civilized. The path to this Goldilocks \nposition, where a sovereign space could be fashioned through its own civilizing projects without \ninviting imperial censure, was not self -evident.  \nThe way to manage these issues was  to preempt empire by narrowing the spectrum in which \nimperial claims could be seen as legitimate.

In other words, any strategy of autoethnography had to \nalso account for the imperial gaze.  \nThis chapter thus examines how deploying the discourse of empire was in fact the Korean \nresponse to the problem of the imperial gaze. As Chos\u014fn envoys tried to resolve various diplomatic \nproblems with the Ming, they negotiated with an aw areness of imperial expectations. As part of their \nstrategy of negotiation, they distilled a particular vision of Korea \u2019s relationship with the Ming from \nvarious possibilities of empire. In other words, they sought to shape Ming policy by narrowing the \nrange of legitimate possibilities for imperial action. These considerations also explain why the early \nChos\u014fn court spent enormous efforts to conceal its own political upheavals, such as internal coup \nd\u2019etats, from the Ming and campaigned for the Ming to rewr ite its unfavorable accounts of the \nChos\u014fn dynasty \u2019s early history. What was at stake was not only legitimacy and esteem. Instead, these \nconcerns were part of this broader diplomatic strategy, which hinged on establishing Korea as a \ncivilized country, rule d by generations of virtuous monarchs, whose unwavering loyalty demanded \nthe Ming reciprocate by behaving exactly in the way the Chos\u014fn desired . \nAt the Emperor \u2019s Court  \nThe Chos\u014fn court and its envoys turned to the \u201cimperializing mode\u201d on a variety of \noccas ions. The envoy Kw\u014fn K\u016dn encapsulated its rhetorical logic when he famously declared in \n1396 to the Ming emperor that \u201cimperial airs\u201d could transcend the boundaries between the \u201ccivilized \nand the barbarian.\u201d The Yalu river that separated Ming and Chos\u014fn wa s thus a mere fact of the \nlandscape, powerless in the face of imperial influence. His statement echoed a point he made several \nyears earlier in 1389, when he wrote on behalf of the Kory\u014f to dispute Ming claims over its \nnortheastern territories: \u201c[our state ] had long dutifully observed the responsibility of the feudal lord; \n \n 122  our land has already entered the imperial domain.\u201d Since empire transcended territorial boundaries \nand Korea was already part of the imperial project, seizing Korean territory was a meani ngless \nventure.38 \nIn 1404, another Chos\u014fn envoy used a similar approach in another appeal over disputed \nterritories. Reminding the Yongle emperor that the Ming dynasty \u201cshould not discriminate against \n[what is outside] its [direct] influence [but should] treat all with equa l benevolence.\u201d39 the envoy \nconvinced the emperor to relinquish claims over Hamju ( \u54b8\u5dde ).

They cajoled him to \naction over the reservations of his officials. The appeals were therefore also vulnerable to the \nvicissitudes of the monarch \u2019s temper.

The Chos\u014fn tried \nagain in 1429, this time to the Xuande emperor.45 The appeal to imperial magnanimity did not \nimmediately prevail. When the Xuande emperor opened the appeal to discussion by the Six Boards, \nthe Board Minister of Finance, Jian Yi \u8e47\u7fa9  (1363 \u20131435), contested the Korean claims and argued \nthat that the tribute of gold and silver was the iron law of the Hongwu emperor, and could not be \naltered.46 The Chos\u014fn court had evidently anticipated this counterargument. It cited one instance \nwhere the Hongwu emperor had refused gifts of gold and silver. It used a rare demonstration of \ngenerosity to represent the original intent of the Ming founder, who had in fact often demanded \nheavy tribute from the Kory\u014f and Chos\u014fn.47 The selective reading of precedents esta blished by the \nformer emperor provided the necessary counterpoint to Jian Yi \u2019s arguments.48 Faced with \ncontending interpretations, the Xuande emperor accepted the Korean appeal, noting Chos\u014fn \u2019s \n\u201cutmost sincerity in Serving the Great\u201d and the necessity of ta king into account the \u201csituation of \nfaraway people.\u201d49 \n                                                 \n45 There are two memorials, one attributed to Py \u014fn Kyeryang sent in 1420, quoted above, and one to Yu Hyot \u2019ong \u516a\n\u5b5d\u901a  (fl. 1408 \u20131431), both of which are reserved in KWTN v.1:9b \u201310a.

It is possible that Yu Hyot \u2019ong\u2019s text was an emendation of Py \u014fn\u2019s \noriginal. However, Yu also  passed a special civil service examination 1427, whose subject included a mock memorial of a \nrequest to the cessation of gold and silver tribute. It is also possible that Yu \u2019s memorial in the KWTN was actually \nselected as a model examination answer.

They also had to \nanticipate how the imperial audience would react. Drawing on an alternative reading of the Hongwu \nemperor \u2019s policies to Korea was but one manner in which the Chos\u014fn preempted possible protests \nby Ming officials. Even before the Chos\u014fn court began its campaign to secure the cancellation of \ntribute in precious metals, its officials proposed that the court discontinu e the use of gold and silver \ndecorations in official court garb and ritual implements. While arguments against the use of precious \nmetals in later periods were rooted in Confucian discourses of moral austerity, these proposals were \ncouched exclusively in t he material difficulties of acquisition and production. They also noted that if \nMing envoys were to see Korean courtiers dressed in gold and silver, they might report to the \nimperial court that Korea in fact abounded in metallic wealth. If the Ming were to  truly believe that \ngold and silver were scarce in Korea, the Chos\u014fn cannot afford to provide  evidence of the \ncontrary.50 Preempting possible protests by Ming officials through selective self -representation was \nan integral part of Korean strategy.  \nAlthough the outcome of these appeals was vulnerable to the predilections of individual \nemperors, once an emperor was convinced, his personal intervention could ensure an appeal \u2019s \nsuccess. The strategy, however, required the presence of a monarch who could devote p ersonal \nattention to Korean affairs. Early Ming rulers like the Hongwu, Jianwen, Yongle and Xuande \nemperors all turned to foreign relations to augment their authority, an interest which granted Korean \n                                                 \n50 Sejong sillok 3:1b [1419/01/06#4]; 13:11b [1421/09/07#5].

As these \nwere a necessary raw material for the construction of composite bows, the Ming  court wished to \nprevent their export to hostile Mongols and Jurchens. Although Koreans were not the original target \nof the ban, the wording of the Ming prohibition prevented Chinese merchants from doing business \nwith all \u201ctribute -bearing barbarians,\u201d incl uding Koreans.

One official suggested that they should \nargue that since the Ming had alway s prohibited envoys from foreign states from carrying weapons \ninto Ming territory, but had permitted Koreans to bear arms, they had assumed the prohibition \nagainst horn export did not apply to them.60 Another angle was to appeal on the basis of precedent. \nThe Hongwu emperor had once bequeathed cannons to the Chos\u014fn. The minister Hy\u014fn S\u014fkkyu \u7384\n\u78a9\u572d  (1403 \u20131480) proposed that one could use that incident to show that the Hongwu emperor \n\u201chad treated our country as a [part of his own] family.\u201d Though Hy\u014fn believed th at this would \ndeflect any blame by the Ming for smuggling arms, he feared that since Chinese officials like the \nSong dynasty minister Su Shi had \u201cseen our country as foreign barbarians,\u201d and had been \u201creluctant \nto give us even books,\u201d a long -term solution to the problem would be elusive.61 A memorial was \nwritten incorporating these arguments, emphasizing Chos\u014fn \u2019s qualitative difference from the \nMongols and Jurchens, and was sent with an embassy in the 8th month of 1477.62 Hy\u014fn \u2019s worries \n                                                 \n59 One of the high officials, Hy \u014fn S\u014fkkyu, pushed for the punishment of the interpreter caught in the act, even though \nhe acknowledged that the smuggling was done in the auspices of the Chos \u014fn state.

When Chos\u014fn envoys arrived in the M ing, they found that the both the \nMinistry of War and the Ministry of Works opposed exporting the horns to Chos\u014fn.63 \nThe Ming ultimately released an edict that permitted the limited purchase of horns. The edict \nrecapped the Korean arguments in the appeal an d proclaimed that although buffalo horns were \nprohibited to barbarians (Ch: huren \u80e1\u4eba ) in principle, this rule would not apply in full force to the \nChos\u014fn.

Ming policy makers \nperceived relations with Korea and other foreign groups as lying along the same continuum.

She was a powerful Korean p alace lady who \nwas sent to join the Xuande emperor \u2019s harem. After his death, she remained in the Ming instead of \nreturning to Korea and was now a lady -in-waiting of the Empress Dowager.68 Her family, the \nCh\u2019\u014fngju Han were a well -connected family in Korea. H er niece was the mother of King S\u014fngjong \n(which made her his great -aunt) and her nephew, Han Ch \u2019irye was the king \u2019s maternal uncle. When \nHan Ch \u2019irye arrived in Beijing, the envoys responsible for appealing the horn prohibition had yet to \nleave.69 Meanwhile,  the eunuch Ch\u014fng Tong, acting on behalf of Lady Han, told Han Ch \u2019irye to \nwrite a letter to relate the Chos\u014fn court \u2019s concerns about the horn prohibition to his aunt. Han \nKwiram soon wrote back, telling her nephew that the matter had been reported directly  to the \nemperor, and would soon be resolved.70 By appealing to Lady Han, the Chos\u014fn acquired permission \nfor horn procurement, though the reservations of the Ming bureaucracy at large was still reflected in \nthe meager quota of fifty horns per annum.  \nKing S\u014fn gjong initially celebrated Han Ch \u2019irye \u2018s success.

The court wished to \nsway Ming policy by demonstrating Chos\u014fn \u2019s dutifulness. If the policy now changed only because of \nbribery or the use of personal connections in the inner palace, the damage to the country \u2019s \nreputation \u201cfar exce eded the benefit of acquiring horns.\u201d For the Chos\u014fn censorate, these actions \nmade Chos\u014fn \u2019s reliability suspect when it was precisely these perceptions of unreliability that had \nelicited the ban in the first place. Han \u2019s actions did a great disservice by u ndermining a reputation \ncarefully cultivated over generations to achieve a momentary goal. In this logic, observation of \npropriety in order to fundamentally shift Ming perceptions, not covert strategies for momentary \nexpedience, was both the only proper me thod and the only viable long term solution.72 \nNonetheless, the permitted volume was still too meager to satisfy Chos\u014fn needs. The \nChos\u014fn continued to petition for more relaxed restrictions, and despite these outstanding \nreservations, its diplomats found the support of the Ming inner palace too effecti ve to forgo.

So Seyang, however, \nsoon heard rumors that led him to believe Su perintendent Zhang had ulterior motives. Chinese \nmerchants offered kickbacks of one -half to the superintendent for permission to do business with \nforeign emissaries. If the prohibitions against travel were to be lifted, these merchants would no \nlonger have  privileged access to the Korean embassy, and the superintendent would no longer be \nable to maintain his racket. Further observation only confirmed his suspicions that Superintendent \nZhang was being duplicitous. He worried that his original petition, which  passed through \nSuperintendent Zhang, was now being suppressed, and would never reach the Ministry of Rites. So \ntook matters into his own hands.  \nNine days after he approached Zhang, on the thirteenth day of the month, So attended a \nwelcoming banquet hoste d by the Ming Minister of Rites, Xia Yan \u590f\u8a00  (1482 \u20131548). He \napproached the minister and prostrated in front of him, ostensibly to offer his thanks for \nconsidering his petition. He also expressed his gratitude for an impending imperial edict that would \nlift the prohibition. It should be noted that  at this point, since he believed Zhang Ao had suppressed \n                                                 \n98 The Ministry of War and the Ministry of Rites fought over control of the Huitong H ostel.

So was only using the opportunity to ascertain whether Xia had actually \nlearned of his petition. Xia nonetheless assured So that the matter was being discussed. After this \nexchange, So remained pessimistic about a possible breakthrough. On the seventeenth day of the \nsame month, an edict arrived permitting Korean emissaries free dom of travel once every five days. \nThe hostel superintendent finally allowed So and his entourage to travel out, but still only under \nclose supervision.99 \nSo and other Korean emissaries had to navigate carefully through the interstices of a \nbyzantine burea ucracy whose precise operation was unpredictable to outside observers.

More important \nwas that by confining Korean embassies like \u201cprisoners\u201d ( \u56da\u7e36 ), Ming officials \u201cnot only violated \nthe rules of old practices,\u201d but also contravened \u201cthe intention of favorable treatment by many past \nemperors.\u201d105 It would ultimately disappoint Korea \u2019s longstanding \u201cadmiration for righteousness\u201d \n(\u6155\u7fa9 ).106 So Seyang \u2019s strategy, then, was to elide the original issues that motivated the restrictive \npolices, those of profit and security, and made them a question of the Ming \u2019s magnanimity and its \nMing \u2019s civilizing project. Instead of challenging directly the Ming rationale fo r these restrictions, So \nshowed how Korea, as a country who admired the Ming, could validate the Ming \u2019s mission civilisatrice.  \nXia Yan \u2019s proposal for limiting Koreans to one free day every five, which the emperor \napproved, sought a compromise between two p ositions. He accepted So \u2019s argument for the large \npart, noting that Chos\u014fn knowledge of \u201critual and ceremony\u201d distinguished them from \u201cbarbarian \nenvoys of other places.\u201d Xia argued So \u2019s desire to be \u201cinfused with the transformative culture\u201d of \nthe imperial  capital was evidence for his \u201csincere veneration of the greater state,\u201d which justified the \nloosening of restrictions. Rhetorically, So Seyang \u2019s appeals were successful, but in practice, Xia \u2019s \npolicies improved the situation only incrementally.

There are several plausible \ninterpretations. One modern scholar, Li Shanhong, understands the gate restriction  issue to reflect \nfundamental conflicts of interest between the Chos\u014fn and the Ming. While the Chos\u014fn desired \naccess, both for cultural goods and for trade opportunities, it was in the Ming \u2019s interest to minimize \nChos\u014fn access to Ming knowledge. Knowing ful l well that Chos\u014fn envoy missions used their \njourney to Beijing as an opportunity to carry out illicit trade, Ming officials like Xia Yan \nacknowledged Chos\u014fn \u2019s appeals to imperial magnanimity and reciprocal relations only on the \nsurface. They maintained re servations towards foreign countries like Chos\u014fn.

So Seyang, privy to Chos\u014fn \u2019s past \ninteractions with the Ming as a high official, and a composer of diplomatic memorials, would not \nhave needed a Ming official to tutor him either in past Ming precedents or the effective use of \nrhetoric.  \nSo Seyang \u2019s appeal  certainly only had a limited initial effect.111 Nevertheless, Ming officials \nwere still compelled to address So \u2019s concerns.

Different \ninterpretations of Korea \u2019s place rationalized different policies. When the 1576 envoy H \u014f Pong left \nBeijing, his entourage was not subject to the expected inspections. Whereas previous inspectors \nwould search their luggage, often at random for smuggled or prohibited goods, when Vice -Director \nof the Bureau of Receptions,113 named Qian, and the S ecretary of the Bureau of Equipment and \nCommunications114 Cao Xi \u66fa\u9291  came for the inspection, they only asked that the Koreans report \nthe contents of their belongings. Qian declared that Korea \u201chad always observed ritual and \nrighteousness,\u201d and so their envoy s would \u201ccertainly not be willing to purchase prohibited items,\u201d \nand so, they could be treated \u201caccording to the precedents reserved for other countries.\u201d115 Qian \u2019s \ncircular reasoning notwithstanding, when officials did inspect Korean baggage, they often did  \ndiscover contraband.

The spatial exile of Chos\u014fn officials to outside the gates implied a parallel ritual demotion. \nFurthermore, exteriority was also synonymous with foreignness and barbarity, especially since these \nenvoys were now  even less esteemed than commoners.  \nPak protested this ritual demotion directly to the Board of Rites.122 Since the affair was \npremised on interpretations of ritual precedence, he had to establish his understanding of Chos\u014fn \u2019s \nposition vis -a-vis the Ming cou rt, before showing why this new move was such an affront. In its first \nlines, Pak argued that even though Korea \u201cwas a foreign vassal in name, it was really the same as \n[the Ming \u2019s] internal realm\u201d ( \u540d\u7232\u5916\u85e9  \u5be6\u540c\u5167\u670d ). Accompanying this rewriting of spatial \ndistin ction was an explanation of why this was the case. The Ming court had long recognized \nKorea \u2019s \u201cloyalty and deference\u201d and \u201cadmiration of righteousness,\u201d and treated Korea with \u201cspecial \nrites, distinct from other countries.\u201d The change in policy then, was a  sudden shift from \u201clong -\nstanding precedents.\u201d It upset the the hierarchical distinctions between \u201cthe esteemed and the base,\u201d \nleaving \u201cmen from afar,\u201d i.e. he, Pak, and his compatriots, \u201ctrembling in confusion, ignorant of the \n                                                 \n121 I.e.

However, even during the time of the Spring and Autumn annals, it was \nunheard of that vassals who came to their king \u2019s court, would be degraded and humiliated by being \nplaced behind the ranks of the base .127 \n                                                 \n123 \u671d\u5ef7\u4ea6\u9451\u5176\u5fe0\u9806  \u5609\u5176\u6155\u7fa9  \u9047\u4ee5\u6b8a\u79ae  \u5225\u65bc\u4ed6\u90a6  \u5176\u5b57\u5c0f\u4e4b\u4ec1  \u7121\u9593\u5167\u5916  \u7737\u5f85\u5bf5\u69ae  \u9761\u6240\u4e0d\u81f3  \u8f03\u8af8\u4e45\u9060\u898b\n\u884c\u4e8b\u4f8b  \u5c0a\u5351\u61f8\u7d76  \u9060\u4eba\u60f6\u60d1  \u7f54\u77e5\u53a5\u7531  \u537d\u6b32\u5448\u7a1f\u4e8e\u8a72\u90e8  \u4ee5\u672a\u884c\u898b\u671d\u4e4b\u79ae  \u4e0d\u6562\u5f91\u9032\u5e72\u5192  \u59d1\u5faa\u65b0\u4ee4  \u96b1\u5fcd\u9077\n\u5c31 \u9766\u9762\u6c57\u80cc  \u7121\u5730\u5bb9\u63aa . \n124 Ch: langzhong  \u90ce\u4e2d  \n125 \u4ea6\u8a1d\u5176\u8b8a\u6613\u4e4b\u8f15\u7387  \n126 \u6b62\u4e4b\u621f\u9580\u4e4b\u5916  \u8207\u5de6\u887d\u7fb6\u919c . \n127 Sogo s\u014fnsaeng munjip  f.3 in HMC 36:294a \u2013294b. \u592b\u4e0a\u570b\u6240\u4ee5\u63a5\u9047\u85e9\u670d  \u81ea\u6709\u6b0a\u5ea6\u66f2\u6298  \u96d6\u5728\u6625\u79cb\u4e4b\u6642  \u5176\u5165\u89b2\u738b\n\u671d \u672a\u805e\u4ee5\u4e0b\u570b\u966a\u8ce4\u800c\u5351\u5937\u4e4b  \u6291\u4e4b\u8ce4\u6d41\u4e4b\u672b\u4e5f . \n \n \n 151   \nHe then w ent on to lecture the Ming on the", "doc_id": "08d65d1a-d55a-4b01-9dfd-f917925ad3c7", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "31898101e3ab1f1c3724ed077a249f04d6086ef0c26b768b7d70b974b49d1bda", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 465970, "end": 467844}, "relationships": {"1": "f47394fe-94c7-4ac0-a316-a92b37a55a86", "2": "de6fbc9b-9f4f-4dc7-b7c9-6985c3ce911c", "3": "98b831c5-1732-43f9-b2b2-5204feb89637"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "98b831c5-1732-43f9-b2b2-5204feb89637": {"__data__": {"text": " \u5176\u5165\u89b2\u738b\n\u671d \u672a\u805e\u4ee5\u4e0b\u570b\u966a\u8ce4\u800c\u5351\u5937\u4e4b  \u6291\u4e4b\u8ce4\u6d41\u4e4b\u672b\u4e5f . \n \n \n 151   \nHe then w ent on to lecture the Ming on the proper operation of government:  \nThose who are in charge of court rituals should always observe the old precedents with resolve like \nthe hardness of metal or stone. If it had been a matter that fomented corruption or interf ered with \ngovernment, and could harm the interests [of the state], then they should have memorialized the \nmatter. It would then have to be delegated to the relevant ministries, who could debate and decide on \na policy to be proposed for imperial consent. Th en it could be promulgated, informing all, so that \nthere would have been no confusion or surprise. If things had been decided this way, then it would be \nin accordance with propriety, and [we] men of afar would have nothing more to say of it.128 \n \nWhat Pak wit nessed at the Ming fell drastically short of proper procedure:  \nNow [however], the imperial court knows nothing of the matter. The relevant ministry does not \ndebate the matter. There is neither half a line of documentation nor a single explanation offered. We \nwere forced by the ceremonial officials with tongues flailing and arms waving, to destroy the old rules \nlong decided by previous reigns and changed a harmless, existing law in a spur of the moment. I have \nthought of this over and over, and I cannot unde rstand it. It must because [the ceremonial officials] \nsee us as lowly messengers from distant marches, ignorant and without learning, so they [believe] they \ncan order us around with impunity....129  \n \nPak\u2019s concern with Korea \u2019s status is clear, but by highlig hting the faults of Ming administration, he \nalso makes a much broader claim. He hones in on two issues. The first is the lack of transparency \nand accountability. The second is what he saw to be an insinuation that Koreans need not be treated \naccording to r ules because they were ignorant foreigners. By asking that decisions regarding the \ntreatment of Korean emissaries be taken both according to precedent and to the routine of \nbureaucratic governance, he not only demonstrated Korean awareness of the operation  of \n\u201ccivilized\u201d governance. Pak was also insisting that Chos\u014fn Korea had a legitimate stake in the \noperation of Ming decision -making and that Ming agencies ought to be accountable to Koreans as well . \nPak thus continued this line of argumentation.  \n                                                 \n128 Sogo s\u014fnsaeng munjip  f.3 in HMC 36:294b. \u53f8\u671d\u5100\u8005  \u56fa\u7576\u7387\u7531\u820a\u7ae0  \u5805\u5982\u91d1\u77f3  \u8a2d\u6216\u6d41\u5f0a\u9632\u653f  \u5728\u6240\u640d\u76ca  \u5247\u4ea6\u7576\n\u7533\u594f  \u59d4\u8af8\u8a72\u90e8  \u8a73\u8b70\u5b9a\u596a  \u53d6\u88c1\u8056\u65b7  \u662d\u5e03\u77e5\u6703  \u4f7f\u7121\u7591\u8a1d  \u5982\u662f\u5247\u8655\u4e8b\u5f97\u9ad4  \u9060\u4eba\u7121\u8fad\u77e3 .", "doc_id": "98b831c5-1732-43f9-b2b2-5204feb89637", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "d8721684f0515609a70a9b57ca07b45f5d141546ea797f69e670c39a0bfd0432", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 468022, "end": 470599}, "relationships": {"1": "f47394fe-94c7-4ac0-a316-a92b37a55a86", "2": "08d65d1a-d55a-4b01-9dfd-f917925ad3c7", "3": "d724ffc8-d6e1-434a-8b10-81e1e2af53c0"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "d724ffc8-d6e1-434a-8b10-81e1e2af53c0": {"__data__": {"text": " \u59d4\u8af8\u8a72\u90e8  \u8a73\u8b70\u5b9a\u596a  \u53d6\u88c1\u8056\u65b7  \u662d\u5e03\u77e5\u6703  \u4f7f\u7121\u7591\u8a1d  \u5982\u662f\u5247\u8655\u4e8b\u5f97\u9ad4  \u9060\u4eba\u7121\u8fad\u77e3 . \n129 Sogo s\u014fnsaeng munjip  f.3 in HMC 36:294b \u2013294c. \u4eca\u8005\u671d\u5ef7\u4e0d\u8207\u77e5  \u8a72\u90e8\u4e0d\u7d93\u8b70  \u7121\u534a\u884c\u6587\u5b57  \u7121\u7247\u8a00\u7aef\u7dd6  \u8feb\u4ee4\u5e8f\n\u73ed \u820c\u6389\u81c2\u63ee  \u7834\u958b\u5148\u671d\u5df2\u5b9a\u4e4b\u820a\u898f  \u6613\u7f6e\u4e00\u6642\u7121\u5f0a\u4e4b\u6210\u6cd5  \u67d0\u7b49\u53cd\u8986\u601d\u60df  \u7aca\u6240\u672a\u55a9  \u5fc5\u4ee5\u7232\u504f\u8352\u8ce4\u4ef7  \u8511\u7121\u77e5\n\u8b58 \u547c\u4f86\u65a5\u53bb  \u8ab0\u6562\u9055\u9006  \u6240\u4ee5\u96a8\u610f\u6307\u4f7f\u800c\u7136\u4e5f . \n \n 152  I, however, believe that  when the imperial court receives [emissaries] from foreign states, every \nannouncement and every instruction is a matter of decorum and propriety ( \u9ad4\u7d71 ).

[Does it not] disappoint our hearts of admiration?130 \nMoreover, the government of a [True] King only promotes when there is good... and punishes only \nwhen there is fault...; our small country has served the  greater with utmost sincerity continuously for \nmany generations, and have no transgressions or cause for guilt. The former emperors of the imperial \ncourt had treated us with munificence and exception, praising and rewarding us. Their edicts are all \nextant  [as proof.] We do not know what fault we committed, that led to our demoted status, or made \nus deserve this punishment.131 \n \nPak concluded his appeal by pointing out that the Chos\u014fn had fulfilled all its obligations. Since \nKorea was faultless and consistent,  any change in Ming behavior would be illegitimate. The Ming \nowed Korea a proportional reciprocity, and now, by arbitrarily altering existing precedents had failed \nnot only Korea, but also its own standards for behavior. It was the court \u2019s duty to treat Ko rea with \ndecorum and propriety, not simply because of what it owed Korea, but also because that is what an \nimperial court  ought to do. Pak drives home his appeal by pointing at the broader ramifications of the \nMing \u2019s failure to observe its own obligations:  \nMy King had always feared the authority of heaven.... [If he were to hear of this matter], he would \ncertainly be alarmed and distraught.... He, along with all the officials and people of our country would \nagitate over this, unable to sleep or eat in peace .132 \n....My ruler guards his small country and must attend to matters dawn to dusk.

Although Ming records make no note of this affair, the \nKorean Veritable Records  indicated that the Board of Rites \u201crestored the rank order to their proper \nplace, and made it standard for perpetuity.\u201d134 The appeal, in the end, was essentially an essay on \nhow an imperial court should  treat its loyal vassals. Though couched  in a diction of perfect deference, \nthe Korean envoy was telling the empire what to do and why.  \nEmpire, then, did not begin and end with the Ming, for at least in theory, the Ming had to \nfollow a set of idealized standards and practices. The Ming court was  responsible for actualizing a \nvision of empire, but it too was supposed to be judged according to those standards. This notion \nwas long in the making, as the written appeals of generations of Korean emissaries and statesmen \nhad tried to make the Ming acco untable to its own ideals. The basic contours of this rhetoric were \nvisible in many places, though at times it took the form of private lamentation.

As one among  a coterie of promising, \nactivist officials in the Chos\u014fn court, he devoted enormous energies to actualizing Zhu Xi -style \nfamily rituals in Korea and Neo -Confucian learning in general.142 His willful flouting of imperial \nauthority suggested Ch \u2019oe believed un iversal Confucian values trumped even the temporal power of \nthe emperor. That, however, did not mean Ch \u2019oe was unconcerned with the imperial gaze. In fact, \nhis obstinacies were also consciously meant to shape imperial perception of Korea. For him, it was \nnot enough to show to the Ming that he was a Chos\u014fn official, but that by demonstrating his \nattention to ritual norms, he could ensure that Korea too could be seen as a civilized state.143  \n                                                 \n140 Ch\u2019oe Pu, P\u2019yohaerok, K\u016dmnam chip  f.4 from HMC 16:441d -442a.  \n141 Ch\u2019oe Pu, P\u2019yohaerok, K\u016dmnam chip  f.5 from  HMC 16:482c \u2013484c.  \n142 Note that Ch \u2019oe Pu \u2019s attention to ritual detail  in his diary may have been in anticipation of the behaviorial \nexpectations at the Chos\u014fn court, where failure to demonstrate proper filial reverence for parents would have earned \nofficial censure.

Like his diplomat colleagues, Ch \u2019oe had \nappropriated discourse that was originally used to legitimate imperial rule to hold its agents \naccountable. That Ch \u2019oe took a play from a dip lomatic repertoire is unsurprising. A munkwa (\u6587\u79d1 ) \nexam passer, he shared a common background in classical knowledge and belles lettres with official \nenvoys and court composers. What is telling, however, is the use of a high language of empire in \ndealings w ith petty imperial agents.  \nFor Ch \u2019oe, his obstinate behavior worked hand in hand with his attempts to cajole Ming \nofficials.  Ch\u2019oe articulated his strategy to his underlings upon their arrival in China.

One low -ranking Ming diplomacy official154 \nsuggested that an imperial doctor be sent to treat the king \u2019s illness, in recompense for the king \u2019s \n\u201cdutiful reverence of the imperial court.\u201d Regardless of whether this plan emerged from friendly \nregard for an ailing monarch of a friendly state or a ploy t o ascertain the truth of the matter, it would \ncertainly have exposed the Korean conspiracy.

The reluctance to report Y\u014fnsan \u2019gun\u2019s death at first was probably because it \nwould rouse suspicions over Chungjong \u2019s legitimacy; the reluctance later was probably because the court did not want \nY\u014fnsangun to receive a glorious sound ing posthumous title ( siho/shihao \u8ae1\u865f ) from the Ming.

The first point was \nthat Yi S\u014f nggye was not in fact Yi Inim \u2019s son. They belonged to separate lineages and rival factions. \nYi Inim was indeed complicit in King Kongmin \u2019s death in 1374, but Yi S\u014fnggye had been \nresponsible for removing Yi Inim \u2019s faction from power in 1388. According to Ch os\u014fn official \nhistoriography, two of the last Kory\u014f rulers, King U and King Ch \u2019ang, were sons of a Buddhist \nmonk, rather than legitimate scions of the Wang royal house.165 Moreover, they were poor rulers \nwho had instigated conflict with the Ming. Yi S\u014fnggye forced their abdication and installed a \nlegitimate Wang scion, King Gongyang in office. King Gongyang then abdicated to the Yi \nwillingly.166 \nThese \u201cdisputing slander\u201d campaigns were tied to both an overriding anxiety over the \nChos\u014fn court \u2019s political legitim acy and a concern with Chos\u014fn \u2019s reputation at the Ming court.167 \nKoh Khee Heong has described these campaigns as an attempt by Koreans to restore their lost \nreputation in the Ming in order to reclaim a comparable loss of legitimacy for the Chos\u014fn dynasty. \nOne caveat to this instrumentalist reading is the question of what exactly this legitimacy meant, for \n                                                 \n164 Ming Taizu \u660e\u592a\u7956  (Zhu Yuanzhang), Huang Ming zuxun  \u7687\u660e\u7956\u8a13  shouzhang , 5a\u20137a in SKCM pt. 2, pp. 167 \u2013168. \n165 This point is disputable.

Furthermore, Ming \nknowledge of Chos\u014fn \u2019s violent establishment had not stopped Min g recognition of Chos\u014fn \nlegitimacy for the past century. If we consider that successful Chos\u014fn diplomacy rested on its ability \nto create and then control stable mythologies for the imperial gaze, then it follows that the \nformalization of a rival narrative thus did not simply threaten existing ones, but the feasibility of \nKorean diplomacy as a whole. The goal was not so much to secure legitimacy f rom the Ming than to \nprotect Chos\u014fn \u2019s past investments in a particular strategy of diplomacy.168 The logic of moder n \nterritorial sovereignty requires defending incursions against claimed space at every juncture, lest the \ndisputed space default to another \u2019s control.169 In much the same way, for the early Chos\u014fn court, \nany assault on its claims to \u201critual and righteousness \u201d must also be protested. Failure to do so would \nmean relinquishing control over self -representation and risk letting an imperial discourse of Korea to \ndefault to one of \u201cbarbarity,\u201d leaving Korea no different from other foreign states.  \nNeither the Chos\u014fn nor the Ming narratives were entirely accurate. The Ming indeed \nconfused Yi S\u014fnggye \u2019s familial identity and erroneously blamed Yi S\u014fnggye for killing the Kory\u014f \nking Kongmin in 1374. Nonetheless, Yi S\u014fnggye \u2019s behavior shadowed that of Yi Inim, who were \nboth powerful military men who controlled court politics from behind the scenes. Yi S\u014fnggye was \nnot involved with King Kongmin \u2019s death, but he and his supporters certainly deposed the latter \nthree monarchs and ordered their deaths.

In other words, efforts by the Chos\u014f n court was as much an attempt to correct Ming \ndocumentation of royal ancestry as it was an attempt to whitewash the bloodshed that surrounded \nChos\u014fn \u2019s rise.  \nChos\u014fn envoys were relatively successful in receiving assurances that the matter would be \namended.

When the court and its envoys to Beijing discussed the diplomatic strategy for \nlobbying the Ming, the matter of past deposed kings, Y\u014fnsan \u2019gun and Nosan \u2019gun \u9b6f\u5c71\u541b177 was \nbroached. Although the Veritable Records omits its details, the diplomatic instructions for the envoys \nto Beijing likely included orders to continue to conceal the Y\u014fnsan \u2019gun affair. One official, the royal \nsecretary Kim Ch\u014fng \u2019guk \u91d1\u6b63\u570b  (1485 \u20131541) protested, and argued that the envoys should not \n\u201cembellish or fabricate.\u201d Kim explained this in terms of moral considerations, but by comparing \nY\u014fnsan \u2019gun\u2019s overthrow to the deeds of ancient sages Yi Yin \u4f0a\u5c39  and the Duke of Zhou \u5468\u516c , \nwho too replaced incompetent or tyrannical rulers with virtuous ones, he l ikely implied that this path \nwas also the most effective. To extrapolate from this logic, showing that irregular succession in \nKorea occurred for only virtuous reasons could then resolve the controversies surrounding the \nChos\u014fn \u2019s founding. The State Counci llor, Sin Yong \u2019gae \u7533\u7528\u6f11  (1463 \u20131519) however, disagreed. \nThe problem was that Korea \u2019s diplomatic posturing thus far had relied on consistent dissimulation. \n                                                 \n175 The Veritable", "doc_id": "e9de89ed-4efe-4a82-acda-6600e65144e9", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "9bce7d40be6dbbfcc1e449d0de7322a10519b087332e234f0a9d24afd9b36efa", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 512999, "end": 515465}, "relationships": {"1": "f47394fe-94c7-4ac0-a316-a92b37a55a86", "2": "e239e920-1268-4294-80b9-d61d6c94c956", "3": "1074c4c3-3306-455d-b64e-3e27dc23afac"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "1074c4c3-3306-455d-b64e-3e27dc23afac": {"__data__": {"text": "problem was that Korea \u2019s diplomatic posturing thus far had relied on consistent dissimulation. \n                                                 \n175 The Veritable Records were only to be consulted for specific reasons, and the Chos\u014fn king himself was barred from \naccessing them, so as  to maintain their credibility as documents of \u201ctrue history.\u201d  \n176 Chungjong sillok 32:64b \u201365b [1518/04/26#1]; f.33:5a \u201333:6a [1518/05/07#4].  \n177 Nosan \u2019gun is better known now by his temple name, Tanjong \u7aef\u5b97 , which was granted to recognize his legitimacy \nas a ki ng of Korea.

The emissaries returned \nwith an official Ming rescript that ackn owledged the mistaken genealogy in the Ming documents and \nassured the Koreans that it would be amended.180 The chief envoy of this mission, Nam Kon \u5357\u889e  \n(1471 \u20131523), was also the drafter of the official memorial that stated the Chos\u014fn case.181 In Beijing, \nNam Ko n also penned his own letter to the Chief Minister of the Board of Rites, Mao Cheng \u6bdb\u6f84  \n(1460 \u20131523). In this letter, Nam recounted the Chos\u014fn position. Like official Chos\u014fn letters, it \nobfuscated the circumstances behind the Chos\u014fn rise, cleaving to the ort hodox narrative, but what \nis interesting is the rhetoric used. Rather than focus on particular details that \u201cproved\u201d the Ming \nnarrative incorrect, he appealed to a logic of empire, explaining why it was the Ming \u2019s moral \nobligation to correct the matter on Chos\u014fn \u2019s behalf.

Once he arrived in Beijing, however, several issues stalled the progress \nof his mission. The Ming Zhengde emperor was away, and was not present to  approve of the Korean petition. Nam \nKon\u2019s official petition hinged on a preexisting precedent during the Yongle reign, but this incident could no longer be \nfound in official Ming records, but it was eventually uncovered in the book held privately by a Min g ceremonial official. \nFinally, the Chos\u014fn envoys wanted to ensure that the language of the Ming rescript did state that the Chos\u014fn had \npetitioned the change or even mention the original allegations. For this reason the Ming made no mention of the \n\u201cassassi nation of the four kings\u201d at the Korean behest. See Chungjong sillok 35:59b [1519/04/07#1].

First, Nam had turned a matter of Korea \u2019s \nreputation into one that impinged on the prestige and legacy of the Ming itself.

For this symbol to be damaged, would be to damage the Ming itself.187 But, most \nimportantly, he transformed a problem of moral -political responsibility in historical representation \ninto an opportunity to use history writing to whitewash the moral reputation of those parties. A \ntarnished Chos\u014fn automatically tarnished the Ming; only by insisting the former be pristine, could \nthe latter remain immaculate.  \nThese \u201cdisputing slander\u201d appeals w orked in the sense that they acquired Ming token \nacknowledgment of the issue at hand, but the actual revision of the Ming Compendium was not \nforthcoming. A massive undertaking, the Ming Compendium had already been printed, and the Chos\u014fn \nwere told to wait for the new edition.

Yet, these figures who challenged (or , allegedly challenged) the \nmonarchy all later enjoyed either official or popular recognition, apotheosized as figures of moral authority. Ch\u014fng \nMongju, Kim Chong \u2019jik and Cho Kwangjo all received veneration in the Confucian temple, constituting a lineage o f \nmoral legitimacy and Confucian orthodoxy that was alternative to the political lineage represented by the kingship itself. \nTheir veneration did not explicitly invalidate the legitimacy of the Chos\u014fn royal house per se, but it compromised its \nability to e xtend its authority over a public discourse ( kongnon \u516c\u8ad6 ) that represented the will of the broader educated \ncommunity .  \n \n \n 172  as a \u201ccountry of pr opriety and righteousness\u201d and a \u201cloyal vassal,\u201d and the Ming as a magnanimous \noverlord were their central rhetorical tropes. They not only figured in Korean appeals itself, they \nwere also reiterated by the rescripts and reactions of Ming officials themsel ves, lending credence to \ntheir effectiveness as diplomatic tools. All the negotiations explored in this chapter, which involved a \nvariety of issues \u2014bullion tribute, buffalo horns, freedom of movement, ritual status, treatment of \nshipwrecks, investiture, us urpation, and historiographical portrayal \u2014converged on this common \nrepertoire of rhetorical strategies. It may be tempting to see Chos\u014fn loyalty, Ming magnanimity, and \na common notion of civilization \u2014ideas considered foundational to the \u201ctributary system\u201d as a \nnormative order \u2014as the reasons for why these campaigns took place and were usually successful. I \ncontend, however, the chain of causality was more likely the inverse. These notions were \nconstructed and deployed to deal with practical concerns. Over ti me, they did acquire a normative \npower, but only because of they were repeatedly used and called upon for particular strategy of \ndiplomacy . And, that strategy  was to create and control a mythology about Korea and its \nrelationship with empire that could wit hstand the vicissitudes of imperial politics.  \nConclusion  \nTo achieve their aims, Chos\u014fn diplomats supported imperial claims of universal sovereignty \nand then turned them on their heads. In the process, Chos\u014fn diplomats also homed in on and then \nreproduced p articular institutional practices, literary motifs, and ritual gestures. Taken together, these \nelements constitute what scholars have often identified as the defining features of the \u201ctributary \nsystem.\u201d What this chapter has shown is that this semblance of  systematicity in fact emerged through  \nthe practice of contentious diplomacy.  \nThese practices constituted Chos\u014fn \u2019s \u201cServing the Great\u201d approach to diplomacy with the \nMing.

Even if \nissues like prestige and legitimacy  in Ming eyes had become ideological goods, valued in and of \nthemselves, and not simply instruments, it did not stop the Chos\u014fn from deploying them in \ninstrumental ways.  \nThe strategies of Chos\u014fn envoys explored in this chapter proved useful at a variety of  \njunctures and  found application well beyond the space of formal diplomacy. Even shipwrecked \nChos\u014fn officials employed these repertoires to deal tactfully with exigencies of being marooned. In \nparticular, the rhetorical strategy they deployed, mirroring th e \u201cimperializing mode\u201d so typical of \nofficial diplomatic discourse, convinced not only emperors and high officials, but also Ming agents \nof all stripes and ranks. Knowledge of empire, in this case, was the mastery of the ways in which the \nideals of empire:  imperial magnanimity, its universal civilizing power, and its duty to loyal vassals \ncould be brought to bear in versatile ways. Chos\u014fn envoys could thus voice their grievances in a \ndiscursive space legitimized by an appeal to empire. It was particularly e ffective on Ming officials \nwho shared a commitment to this political imaginary and believed that the imperium \u2019s relations with \nits neighbors ought to be expressed in terms of the Ming \u2019s civilizing influence and magnanimous \ntreatment of outsiders. Commitmen t need not imply wholehearted compliance. A Ming agent \nsharing a concern only for the mere image of the Ming -as-virtuous granted enough room for Chos\u014fn \nemissaries to maneuver.  \nRoom for maneuver did always translate into success, especially since ideals, whether \nsincerely believed or pretentiously enforced, could not preclude considerations of profit, power, and \npolitics. The colloquial Chinese adage, \u201ca scholar who crosses a warrior may have right on his side, \n \n 174  but he won \u2019t explain it clearly\u201d192 colorfully illustrates two problems with reliance on rhetoric and \nideals as one \u2019s sole weapons. The first is that convincing rhetoric depends on the audie nce in \nquestion; the second is that, in the microcosmic scale of the personal, coercion always trumps \npersuasion. This statement would probably have resonated with Chos\u014fn envoys who had to bribe \ntheir Ming handlers to carry out even routine tasks like buyi ng groceries.193 The envoy H\u014f Pong, in \nhis travelogue from a 1576 envoy mission, relates an incident involving the highest -ranking official \nof the Liaodong command, Chen Yan \u9673\u8a00 , to illustrate the abuses Korean emissaries suffered at \nthe hands of local offici als. Chen asked Chos\u014fn envoys to bring a number of gifts for him, five \ncopies of the Brilliant Flowers Anthology  (Hwanghwajip \u7687\u83ef\u96c6 ), sixty rolls of fine memorial paper, and \nfive Korean -style horsehair hats.", "doc_id": "56b01b95-1e9d-4f76-9b20-0da0f3319851", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "52b8d4c40ce2a484e9def29195189f7157c68dbff147bdbd0dec3aa01512ee17", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 530711, "end": 533905}, "relationships": {"1": "f47394fe-94c7-4ac0-a316-a92b37a55a86", "2": "b4eb2556-039b-468e-a66b-70f12c24f488", "3": "b648d0c7-04e0-49fb-a292-6ed02579ec0e"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "b648d0c7-04e0-49fb-a292-6ed02579ec0e": {"__data__": {"text": "hands of local offici als.

The Chos\u014fn court refused, believing that acceding to him will \ninvite \u201climitless abuses,\u201d and gifted him only one copy of the anthology.194 Chen Yan, offended by \nthe meager gift, demanded from the envoy mission luxurious trade items: otter skins, fine woven \nmats, cotton cloth, an inkstone, multicolored silk embroidery, and ginseng for trade. When the \nChos\u014fn interpreter insisted that some of these items could not be acquired, because of their status as \nimperial tribute gifts, Chen only grew angrier and froced the interpreter to accept the silk bolts he \noffered  as \u201cpayment.\u201d195 The Korean interpreter in charge of representing the mission later tried to \nplacate the official with offerings of other goods.

This rhetoric, as Kim Y\u014fngmin, who in borrowing the words of \nJames Scott, has argued, was a \u201cweapon of the weak\u201d against the strong.197 It was used against the \nvery people who \u201cviolated....

Chen \u2019s predecessor had in \nfact been removed for corruption and graft. Che n simply knew to present a different image of \nhimself to his superiors in the imperial court. When the imperial embassy to Korea, led by Han \nShineng \u97d3\u4e16\u80fd  (1528 \u20131598), passed through the region, Chen posted a declaration prohibiting \nabuses against the locals and Korean officials. Once they departed, however, he simply resumed his \nacquisitive ways.202 H\u014f Pong relates another incident involving a protocol of ficial203 from the Court \nof Ceremonies named Xu Jiru \u8a31\u7e7c\u5112 , who demanded from the Koreans a gift of fifty bolts of \nwhite cloth. The Koreans had none to give him. Thus refused, Xu Jiru, grew upset and took out his \nanger on an employee of the Huitong Hostel. The  employee reported the actions to their superiors. \nAfter an investigation, Xu Jiru was sentenced to exile and conscription in the frontier army. He was \nlevied a fine of one ounce of silver for each bolt of cloth he had demanded. The matter ended in \ngreater  tragedy. Xu Jiru had to sell all of his property to pay the fine.

Ming officials were not the only individuals \nwho sought rents through tribute trade. Chos\u014fn interpreters and officials alike made use of travels to Beijing for \nprofiteering. The Chos\u014fn court attempted to crack dow n on smuggling, both to alleviate the strains placed upon local \ncorvee labor from overburdened baggage trains and to improve the image of Korean embassies in the eyes of Ming \nofficials.

One might be tempted to dismiss all this as completely hypocritical; but hypocrisy is \nonly so because power is concerned with image \u2014so long as  his image mattered, a  hypocrite can still \nbe cowed.  \nThe concern with image was shared by both the Ming and Chos\u014fn, but as this chapter \nshowed, images: perceptions, representations, and impressions were important tools of argument for \nestablishing precedents. Images reify the p ermanence of the imperial project and its tradition, but it \nalso leaves it abstracted from particular circumstances \u2014at once both a denial of their own historicity \nand an assertion of history \u2019s value.

In this \natmosphere of unpredictability, the appeal to precedent, whether in the context of Chos\u014fn -Ming \nrelations as a whole, the classically sanc tioned duty of empire, or even the discrete relations between \nindividual actors, could provide a modicum of consistency and reliability. Korean maintenance of an \n \n 178  idiom of empire, one in which the Ming was a generous, virtuous, and magnanimous overlord and \nthe Chos\u014fn was a dutiful, civilized, moral, and deferent subject must also be understood in in light \nof this process. The reification and the idealization of the Ming, Chos\u014fn \u2019s dynastic past, and the \ninstitutions of diplomatic practice, then, was less an a ttempt to whitewash the obvious shortfalls of \nreality, than a way to create normative guides to set the parameters of the relationship.  \nAs we see in the examples explored in this chapter, maintaining these idealizations required \nregular diplomatic activity . Envoys had to make sure that the Koreans were always represented in a \npositive light, that usurpations were not recorded in Ming historical writings, and that Korean rulers \nwere given the patents of investiture they required. To achieve these goals requi red navigating \nthrough the patrimonial networks within the Ming bureaucracy itself. It meant cultivating ties with \nindividual Ming officials and reading the fractures of power within the imperial court. These \nactivities point also to a different kind of kn owledge: a familiarity with the political realities of the \nMing court and a practical ken of how to use them.  \nThe next chapter therefore will examine another set of tools in the repertoire of a Korean \nenvoy, a \u201cknowledge of empire,\u201d constituted not by hist orical precedents and imperial logics, or the \nrhetorical strategies of their use, but the concrete understanding of how the Ming worked. This \nknow -how was important because it helped convert a drastic differential of power between the \nChos\u014fn and the Ming i nto a set of asymmetries in which the Chos\u014fn in fact acquired advantages in \nthe form of knowledge. Behind a rhetoric of empire that normalized political asymmetry and \nhierarchy by upholding Ming moral  and political superiority, were a set of practices that gave the \nChos\u014fn a valued space of agency, which proved not only instrumental in the functioning of the \nChos\u014fn state but also integral to sustaining Chos\u014fn -Ming relations as a whole.  \n \n179 Chapter 3  \nKnowledge of Empire and the Dynamics of Asymmetry  \nOn the 27th  day of the eleventh month of 1542, the Chos\u014fn court learned from a returning \nenvoy of startling developments at the Ming court.

The Chos\u014fn court knew more about the Ming because the \nMing mattered more to it.  \nThis combination of what Womack has called respectively, \u201cthe politics of inattention\u201d and \n\u201coverattention,\u201d were seeds of instability. Uncoordinated policies from the Ming produced \ncontradictory signals and could lead to small crises which, when interpreted i n Chos\u014fn through the \nlens of heightened attention, could escalate into larger confrontations.13 Nonetheless, early  Chos\u014fn -\nMing relations are illustrative of \u201cnormative asymmetry,\u201d situations in which asymmetrical relations \nwere stable, consistent, and peace able over long periods. Such stability should not be taken for \ngranted. Not all asymmetrical relations stabilize \u2014small states are in fact sometimes destroyed as \nsmall crises snowball into existential conflicts. The stability of fifteenth and sixteenth cent uries, then, \nwas not the logical outgrowth of asymmetrical dynamics. The imbalance of power the Chos\u014fn faced \nmay have been inherent to its historical and geopolitical situation, but the stability of its relations \nwith the Ming required effort: in particula r a significant investment in the relationship on the part of \nthe Chos\u014fn court.  \nTo understand how the Chos\u014fn and Ming managed a persistent, if occasionally fractious, \npeace, one must delve into how such asymmetrical relations were actually managed. Womack \nproposes that the management of asymmetrical relations requires the recognition of the asymmetry \nof the relations by both sides and relies potentially on two \u201csleeves of negotiation.\u201d One is the \nestablishment of multilateral institutions and cross -cutting connections that can manage crises; the \nother is the history of the relationship itself, i.e. the force of precedent.14 These features are \nobservable in the Chos\u014fn case. Ji -young Lee, drawing on Womack \u2019s insights, has argued that the \n                                                 \n13 Womack, China and Vietnam , 82\u201385. \n14 Womack, China and Vietnam , 89\u201392. \n \n 184  policy of sadae (\u201cserving the great \u201d \u4e8b\u5927 ) was a \u201cmechanism adopted to reduce the tensions\u201d in a \nsituation of power asymmetry.15 In the same vei n, the language of hierarchy that suffuses Chos\u014fn -\nMing discourse and the persistent use of \u201cimperializing mode \u201d in Korean diplomacy explored in the \nprevious chapters can be seen as mechanisms for making explicit this hierarchy.

The conversion was  achieved through deliberate \nchoices in strategies of information control and self -representation in Chos\u014fn diplomacy. \nAsymmetry of power was reversed into an  asymmetry of knowledge.  \nThe Chos\u014fn court cultivated this imbalance of knowledge by carefully limited access to \ninformation about Korea and tailored its self -representation. The production of knowledge for \nengaging the Ming went hand in hand with these representations of Korea custom ized for Ming \neyes. Travel to Korea during this period was limited strictly to the occasional imperial envoy. His \narrival often stimulated a wholesale refurbishing of Chos\u014fn \u2019s ceremonial display.

They blurred the boundary between official and un official \ncontact as sanctioned institutional interchange was shadowed by emergent webs of interest. Through \nthese connections, the Chos\u014fn developed a stronger awareness of Ming institutions, which in turn \nallowed for more effective diplomacy. Together thes e dynamics explain the relative richness and \nfocus of Korean documentation of Chos\u014fn -Ming relations. This richness relied on concerted efforts \nin preservation, formalization and integration; it was not the natural result of asymmetrical relations \nof power and knowledge, but a consequence of Chos\u014fn strategy in navigating the institutions in \ntribute.  \nThe second half of this chapter shifts the discussion towards the kinds of information the \nChos\u014fn court acquired through its traveling envoys.

Maintaining stable ties with the Ming were far from the inevitable \nresult of tributary relations, but instead demanded the regular flow of new information. In the \nmeantime, information about the Ming, strongly colored Chos\u014fn perceptions about the state of \nMing governance and the personal virtue (or lack thereof) of its rulers. Its seasonal celebrations of \n \n 188  Ming virtue and splendor notwithstanding, the Chos\u014fn harbored no illusion about the Ming \u2019s \nexcesses and abuses. For the Chos\u014fn court, the Ming never really represented an unquestioned \nsource of moral authority, even if  the language and discourse of tribute seem to suggest it was. There \nare broader implications for th is observation, which will be explained in the conclusion.  \nMatters of Time and Space: Envoy Missions as Intelligence Operations  \nThe Chos\u014fn dispatched at least three tribute missions a year to the Ming for over two \nhundred years. The nomenclature of Chos\u014fn embassies suggest that \u201ccoming to court\u201d ( \u4f86\u671d ) \nacknowledged Ming centrality and superiority in a logic of ritual hierarchy. These three regular \nembassies were described in the language of ceremony and tribute: to express felicitations and \npresent gifts for the new year ( hach\u014fng \u8cc0\u6b63 ), the imperial birthday ( s\u014fngj\u014fl \u8056\u7bc0 ), and the heir \napparent birthday (lit. Thousand Autumns, ch\u2019\u014fnch\u2019u \u5343\u79cb ), which was eventually replaced by the \nwinter solstice mission ( tongji \u51ac\u81f3 ).22  \nThe burden of travel fell largely on Korean env oys. Chos\u014fn envoys traveled significantly \nmore frequently to the Ming than vice -versa. Ming envoys came to Chos\u014fn relatively frequently in \nthe early half of the fifteenth century23 but did so very rarely in the sixteenth century.24 Even with \nthis decline of  Ming embassies, from several a year to one or two a decade, the Chos\u014fn court still \n                                                 \n22 For exhaustive tabulations of envoy mission types, see Ch\u014fn Haejong, \u201cHan -Chung chogong gwan \u2019gye kaeron,\u201d 54 \u2013\n60. see also Gari Ledyard, \u201cKorean Travelers in China over Four Hundred Years, 1488 -1887,\u201d Occasional Papers on Kore a, \nno. 2 (March 1, 1974): 1 \u201342. \n23 2.7 missions per year during the reign of King T \u2019aejong and 1.1 missions per year during the reign of Sejong.

Chos\u014fn observa nce \nof ritual codes and precedents in regular acknowledgment of Ming political superiority sent \nconsistent signals to the Ming, valuable in a context of power asymmetry as a way to avoid conflict.27 \nFor any one side to alter precedents, even pro forma ones,  may lead to unnecessary \nmisunderstandings; as such, the diplomacy relies on mutually agreed upon practices. Institutional \ninertia results because the parties involved \u201creiterated\u201d the terms together in the course of dealings. \nThe precedents established th rough reiteration often operate with guiding principles quite abstracted \nfrom the initial context that birthed them.28 It should also be noted, however, that this hierarchy \nexisted only because such rituals constituted them by producing meaningful distincti ons and markers \nof that hierarchy. Without the rituals of envoy exchange, and when their attendant pronouncements \n                                                 \n25 Frequent envoy missions in general placed an enormous burden  on the resources and capacities of the early Chos\u014fn \nstate. Petitions from central officials and local governors alike pointed to the strains such embassies placed on local \nresources.

There is no reason to \npresume the inherent normativity of the European interstate mod el outside of its own historicity, but yet the assumption \nof its normativity has colored existing scholarship to the point that comparisons are made only to emphasize what was \nlacking in the East Asian system, an approach David Kang has cautioned against. Fallacies of anachronism and \nincongruities of hindsight occur when due vigilance regarding the historicity of diplomacy and its institutions are not \nexercised. For instance, one scholar, in this vein, has suggested that reliance on envoys for their \u201clitera ry skills\u201d to \ndemonstrate Chos\u014fn cultural attainments, instead of a professionalized diplomatic staff with \u201cdiverse abilities,\u201d \ndemonstrates a general \u201climitation\u201d of Chos\u014fn diplomacy. Such a view implicitly replaces the actual priorities of the \nChos\u014fn sta te with the expectations of modern diplomatic practice and in fact overlooks the existence of career \ndiplomats: the interpreters who accompanied the official envoys. At the other extreme, the nature of envoy travel in \nearly modern East Asia have been commo nly misrepresented, where Chos\u014fn and Ming were akin to the ambassadors of \ncontemporary international diplomacy, living in foreign countries as permanent representatives, a view that has spilled \nover into popular misconceptions.

Intelligence \nacquisition was formalized in the institutional organization of these envoy missions.  Designated \nmembers of the embassies: the chief envoy and his vice -envoy had to stay with the mission for its \nentire duration, many individuals in this coterie had a much more flexible role. The permanent staff \nof an embassy included a number of official interpreters45 Some of these traveled as  \u201cadvance \ninterpreters\u201d( s\u014fnnae t \u2019ongsa \u5148\u4f86\u901a\u4e8b ), detached from the main body of the  embassy to relay urgent \nmatters.46 Nearly every envoy mission traveling between Beijing and Seoul dispatched these \nmessengers for delivering information in a timely fashion.47  \nThis mechanism of transmission sometimes delivered valuable information weeks in advance \nof an official Ming embassy. In this manner, m ajor events in the Ming court would often be privy to \nthe Chos\u014fn before the information was disclosed through official ch annels or proclaimed by Ming \nenvoys. The Chos\u014fn court usually learned the identities of the Ming emissaries, their purpose, and \nplanned departure dates if not the precise timetable well ahead of time.48 Once within Chos\u014fn \nterritory, information could travel  even faster. Messages could travel by horse from \u016ciju to Seoul \nwithin three days.49 Anticipating the arrival of an envoy mission provided the Chos\u014fn court time to \nmake advance preparations and adjust to changing circumstances.50 When it learned from an earl ier \n                                                 \n45 Kim Ky\u014fngnok \u91d1\u66bb\u9304 , \u201cChos\u014fn sidae chogong ch \u2019eje,\u201d 99 \u2013106; Yang Yulei, Yanxing yu Zhong -Chao wenhua , 23\u201325. \n46 This practice was formalized in institutional texts such as the T\u2019ongmungwanchi and the Ky\u014fngguk Taej\u014fn.  \n47 Kim Ky\u014fngnok, \u201cC hos\u014fn sidae tae Chungguk oegyo muns\u014f \u016di ch\u014fpsu - pojun ch \u2019aegye \uc870\uc120\uc2dc\ub300  \ub300\uc911\uad6d  \n\uc678\uad50\ubb38\uc11c\uc758  \uc811\uc218\u318d\ubcf4\uc874\uccb4\uacc4 ,\u201d Han\u2019guksa Y\u014fn \u2019gu no. 136 (March 2007): 146 \u2013147. \n48 Sejo sillok  15:25a [1459/03/27#4].  \n49 Three days is probably close to the fastest time possible when traveling through  the waystation system.

The channels of \ncommunication and opportunities for collusion these interactions opened up are key to \nunderstanding Chos\u014fn diplomacy.  \nIn principle, diplomacy was the strict purview of rulers. Prohibitions against lateral dealings \nbetween their minions emerged from recognizing how contacts could be exploited for personal gain \nby agents of both courts. The chains of mutual benefit could therefore compromise their integrity \nand dependability.

From the Ming perspective, the \nprinciple, in theory, also ap plied to the  Chos\u014fn king, who as a vassal of the Ming emperor, was not \nto have private relations of his own, let alone those with Ming subjects barred from such dealings in \nthe first place.67 When Chos\u014fn envoys presented a gift of horses at the request of the Prince of  Yan \n(\u71d5\u738b , later the Yongle emperor), the Hongwu emperor arrested and exiled the Chos\u014fn envoys to \nYunnan, charging, \u201chow could the King of Chos\u014fn [be allowed to] have private relations?\u201d68 \nThese declarations were also part of a discourse of sovereignty that imagined the Ming \nemperor and Chos\u014fn king in a personal relationship of lord and subject, synecdochal for the ritual \nstatus of their respective states.

As the imperial person retreated from everyday politics, lateral r elations and \nthe informal channels they engendered became ever more important.  \nBetween Ming eunuchs of the inner palace, military officers posted at the borders, and \nfunctionaries responsible for entertaining foreigners, a Chos\u014fn envoy mission had to move through \nmany channels and thread many interstices.  Contact with these groups fell within the bounds of \nsanctioned contact, since official business required it, but it was not always clear when formal \nbusiness ended and the personal began. The lines between the sanctioned and prohibited were often \nblurred, as was that between the public and the clandestine. Iron prohibitions against \u201cpersonal\u201d \ndealings would have been impractical and the principle was regularly flouted by Ming and Chos\u014fn \nagents alike. Even during periods when strict curfew regulations were in place, designed to prevent \nthis sort of lateral contact, Chos\u014fn envoys still managed to seek out Ming literati who had visited \nChos\u014fn, bringing them gifts from Korea, though the court did tread carefully, keeping the principle \nof sovereign monopoly in mind.70 Yet, Chos\u014fn attention to t hese lateral ties sometimes eclipsed \nwhat was due to the emperor. If quantity is a valid measure, Korean gifts to visiting Ming envoys \noften far exceeded the formal tribute due to the emperor himself.71 Contact with high profile figures \nlike Ming princes or  former Ming envoys led to greater scrutiny, but the less prominent the agent, \nthe more room for maneuver there was.

Although some permeability \nwas possible between them, each group \u2019s career trajectories, sources of institutional power, and \nstrategies for acquiring social and cultural prestige differed dramatically. The way to success for a \npalace eunuch was fundamentally  different from the path of advancement open to a degree -holding \nliterati official. A eunuch under the service of the emperor might view the acquisition of gifts for the \nemperor to be his duty as an imperial envoy, while even a greedy literati might still appeal to and \nperform the values of austerity and restraint.91 Reputations of moral virtue and literary talent were \nconducive to advancement in the civil bureaucracy, but this channel of advancement was barred to \nhereditary military households. A military o fficer stationed in Liaodong, with regular interactions \nwith Chos\u014fn emissaries, might turn instead to a long -term rent -seeking relationship of informal \npatronage with the Chos\u014fn court, where customary gifts and political favors translated to tangible \ngain.92 The Chos\u014fn court, then, had to understand the incentive structure that motivated", "doc_id": "beabe96c-9c6e-4267-9075-138380400d97", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "7fae593b9f4df619cebff1c4253f17ee07d9c88630f63b97de470c444d3b1fef", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 627999, "end": 631080}, "relationships": {"1": "f47394fe-94c7-4ac0-a316-a92b37a55a86", "2": "6a550c63-6dac-4287-a6ac-ed1772827b56", "3": "70903cdc-35ac-4960-ab43-44ef85d7b327"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "70903cdc-35ac-4960-ab43-44ef85d7b327": {"__data__": {"text": "Chos\u014fn emissaries, might turn instead to a long -term rent -seeking relationship of informal \npatronage with the Chos\u014fn court, where customary gifts and political favors translated to tangible \ngain.92 The Chos\u014fn court, then, had to understand the incentive structure that motivated each \ngroup.

Liaodong, as the point of entry to Ming \ndomains, received Korean embassies on a regular basis, who in turn required the Liaodong \ngovernment \u2019s cooperation in nearly all matters related to the Ming.93 Chos\u014fn contact with Liaodong \nCommand was thus official, documented in a \u201cpaper trail.\u201d The correspondences acknowledged the \nlegitimacy of these interactions, as its discourse, the bureaucratic language of the Ming, treated \nChos\u014fn as a virtual branch of the  imperial government.94 Yet, it was precisely in these sanctioned \navenues of contact that that official prohibitions against private dealings were most impractical.  \nIn the shadow of these public, official dealings were a host of other interactions absent fr om \nthese formal, bureaucratic correspondences. Nonetheless appearing in Chos\u014fn records, they \nstraddled the boundary of the public and the private, the official and the unofficial. Responsibility \nfor enforcing Ming regulations fell on military officers like  the Liaodong Commander and his \nsubordinates. Korean clandestine trade in in prohibited goods like horn for making composite bows, \ngunpowder, and history books occurred with their tacit approval, with Ming military officers \nsometimes choosing to make excep tions.95 Ming officers also often relayed information to the \n                                                 \n93 With th e exception of the later years of Chos\u014fn -Ming diplomacy when a sea route was used to circumvent the region,", "doc_id": "70903cdc-35ac-4960-ab43-44ef85d7b327", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "44349518ed04d0113c810c761d6f67b894cc59c7a4ba2dcfea4a247ba98c1d05", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 631072, "end": 634088}, "relationships": {"1": "f47394fe-94c7-4ac0-a316-a92b37a55a86", "2": "beabe96c-9c6e-4267-9075-138380400d97", "3": "ae0e7fc1-1bc2-405a-9470-0604620e2344"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "ae0e7fc1-1bc2-405a-9470-0604620e2344": {"__data__": {"text": "                                            \n93 With th e exception of the later years of Chos\u014fn -Ming diplomacy when a sea route was used to circumvent the region, \nalready under Manchu control, no Chos\u014fn embassy could enter the Ming without first passing through Liaodong. In \n1393 the Hongwu emperor, offended by  his manner of kneeling, sent a Korean envoy back to Chos\u014fn. The emperor \nprohibited the waystations from providing him with board and horses, so the envoy trekked home on foot. The emperor \nthen ordered the Liaodong commander refuse other Chos\u014fn embassies. For the remainder of the year, all Chos\u014fn \nembassies were denied entry to Ming territory.

The repatriation of shipwrecked Koreans by the Ming or the Chos\u014fn repatriation of Chinese who escaped \nfrom Jurchen enslavement were some examples.

Each passing envoy trip, each favor done by the Liaodong \nmilitary for the Chos\u014fn was an opportunity for personal gain.102 For the Chos\u014fn court however, \nthis reliance only exacerbated the prob lem of graft for its embassies, but  this was only one side of \nthe story.  \nIt is tempting to see these emergent ties as simply \u201ccorruption.\u201d Certainly, the behavior of \nmany Ming officials disappointed the expectations of their Chos\u014fn guests, but these operat ions was \nnot a debased version of preexisting system that functioned without these practices. This was the \nsystem. The difference between a gift, a bribe, and a commodity for trade was also contextual and \nrelative.

Not simply tit -for-tat, they were integral to th e cultivation of long -term \nrelations on both the institutional and personal level.

Much of diplomatic activity was in fact highly localized, as \nMing agents acted independently of the Ming itself.

All things have their rise and fall. The emperor disobeyed \nhis father \u2019s commands and seized the throne for himself.

Though still convinced \nthat the Ming, already burdened with war elsewhere, would not in vade Chos\u014fn, T \u2019aejong did not \npreclude such a possibility in his calculations.142 In this vein, T \u2019aejong \u2019s diplomacy of \u201cserving the \ngreat,\u201d was not a passive reaction to Ming power, but a strategy that both anticipated a vast \ndifferential in power and sough t to preserve a space for Korean agency. The goal was not to defeat a \nMing invasion by the walls of the Chos\u014fn capital, but to prevent it from materializing all together.  \nIt is remarkable that T \u2019aejong maintained a consistent diplomatic approach, without \nresorting to preemptive military solutions, despite the near unanimous advice of his officials.

On the \nother hand, his advisers, like Ha Yan, lacked proper Confucian learning, and had a \u201csuperficial understanding\u201d of how \nthe tributary system worked, an d thus misread the Yongle emperor \u2019s intentions. Huang \u2019s logic and reading of the sources \nhere is specious. Chos\u014fn officials like Ha Yan were in fact no less steeped Confucian letters than T \u2019aejong; it is also \ndifficult to see how the turn to diplomacy can be attributed to Confucian inclinations in this instance.

He ha d no illusions about the emperor \u2019s motivations in the invasion of Vietnam, \nwhich he called a \u201cmoral error\u201d of the emperor, but he saw the Mongolian campaigns to be \nmotivated by a different set of priorities. As a war to eliminate \u201cbrigands at [the Ming \u2019s own] front \ngates,\u201d it concerned the Ming \u2019s own security. Since the emperor thus far treated Chos\u014fn with \n\u201cextreme generosity,\u201d Chos\u014fn \u2019s diplomacy appeared to be working. In his reckoning, an \u201calliance \nwith the superior state\u201d was enough to \u201cpreserve this one region [i.e. Korea],\u201d though he ultimat ely \nstill acknowledged that \u201csecuring this fiefdom\u201d may one day still require \u201cstockpiling grain and \ntraining troops.\u201d144 \nKing T \u2019aejong coul d not have made his strategic  assessments without the steady relay of \ninformation about the Ming from his  envoys. Here , as elsewhere, diplomacy was not only a \nmechanism for engaging the Ming, but was also a conduit for intelligence. This relationship between \nthe flow of information about the Ming and broader strategic considerations persisted well after \nfears of invasion subsided. For example, in 1481 Chos\u014fn learned from its emissaries that the Ming \nwished to establish a fortress near the Chos\u014fn border in order to protect Chos\u014fn embassies from \nmarauding Jurchens. The court official Yang S\u014fngji \u6881\u8aa0\u4e4b  (1415 \u20131482) found this de velopment \nworrisome. He explained that the Ming Hongwu emperor \u2019s willingness \u201cto allow Chos\u014fn \u2019s own \nsovereignty in rule\u201d was not simply because of cultural differences between Korea and China.145 It \nwas rather because Korea had successfully resisted the aggr essions of past imperial dynasties.

The clarity of \nhindsight assures us that Chos\u014fn -Ming relations were to remain relatively  peaceful, but Chos\u014fn \ncourt did not have the benefit of prescience in its political calculus.

When Ming armies did one day come to Korea, it \nwas to defend it from a Japanese invasion in 1592. The experience of the subsequent I mjin War \nmight suggest that Chos\u014fn \u2019s allegiance to the Ming was for protection, but Chos\u014fn never anticipated \nsuch a cataclysmic invasion from the east, let alone pursue a consistent diplomatic policy for two \ncenturies for such a goal.

Just as Schneewind has asked of \u201cthe loyalty, the lifetime service, even the death as \nfaithful martyrs of many of their subjects,\u201d a similar question could be asked of the Chos\u014fn court. \nWhy?164 \nThat this outward presentation of reverence w as only an expedient means to avert Ming \nintervention in Korean affairs is a tempting answer. The Chos\u014fn court, even as it observed what it \ntook to be the Ming court \u2019s political degeneration, never voiced its criticisms openly to a Ming \naudience. In moment s where the Ming had the most reason to doubt its own authority, the Chos\u014fn \nenvoys came to gently stroke away the anxieties of those in power. When examined in terms of the \nenvoy mission \u2019s function of intelligence gathering, interpreting Chos\u014fn behavior as  a utilitarian \n\u201coutward obeisance\u201d appears even more convincing. The Chos\u014fn was mainly interested in Ming \npolitics for how its developments affected Korea. The state of Ming governance in China was \ngenerally abstracted from the day -to-day operation of Chos \u014fn politics. Only when border conflicts \nor imperial invasion threatened Chos\u014fn \u2019s security did they matter. The excesses of one individual \nMing ruler did not matter, so long as diplomacy could stave off the immediate effects of his failings.  \nThe problem wi th the utilitarian view is that it alone cannot account for the full range of \ninformation that the Chos\u014fn envoys actually brought back. Intelligence was but only one area of \ninformation transmission; Chos\u014fn interest in the Ming was not limited to areas of realpolitik.

Ming cases became points of reference for their \nown political agenda. Awareness of Ming practice certainly shaped Chos \u014fn court debates, but the \nmotivations were always tied up in Chos\u014fn concerns.

Ming \ngovernance, then, provided case examples of statecraft in action, not a model for unqualified \nemulation. It was possible for courtiers to borrow the authority of t he imperial state to justify their \nown policy point, as S\u014fng did.169 But pressure for reform according to the model of Ming Chinese \ninstitutions could always be deflected with a simple acknowledgment that \u201cthere is much in [Korea] \n                                                 \n168 Michel Foucault, The Archaeology of Knowledge; And, The Discou rse on Language  (New York: Pantheon Books, 1982), 149 \u2013\n150. \n169 Chungjong sillok  9:35a [1509/09a/10#1].  \n \n 235  that do not follow Chinese institutions \u2014there is no need to change everything.\u201d170 To see Ming \ninstitutions, not as models for emulation, but as cases for illustration, also absolve the need to \ndichotomize Chos\u014fn opinions of the Ming in terms of positive and negative appraisals.

When Kw\u014fn Pal condemned the \nJiajing emperor in 1542, he evoked the lessons of self -cultivation and self -regulation in the Greater \nLearning in his critique of monarchical despotism. When he, and other Korean officials, appealed to \nthese enlightened rulership in their  moralizing diagnosis of Ming decline, o ne wonders whether they \nwere in fact veiled reminders for their o wn rulers on the dangers of monarchical excess.171 Kw\u014fn \u2019s \nruler, Chungjong, for example was known for punishing officials who were too forward in their \nremonstrance. The so -called \u201cliterati purges\u201d ( sahwa  \u58eb\u798d ) of 1498 and 1504, carried out by his \npredecessor Y\u014fnsangun, and the 1519 purge that Chungjong ena cted himself could not have been \ntoo far distant in the court \u2019s collective memory.172 Negative portrayals of the Zhengde emperor, for \ninstance, could have been used to justify the 1506 removal of the unpopular ruler Y\u014fnsangun, and as \n                                                 \n170 Chungjong sillok  5:6a [1508/01/08#1].  \n171 In other cases, the use of Ming emperors as negative examples is more explicit. In 1508, the Councilor S\u014fng H\u016diy \u014fn \nused the Zhengde emperor \u2019s fondness of eunuchs to admonish the young king Chungjong over his own behavior. \nChungjong sillok 5:25b [1508/02/12#1].  \n172 Edward W Wagner, The Literati Purges: Political Conflict in Early Yi Korea  (Cambridge: East Asian Researc h Center : \nDistributed by Harvard University Press, 1974).  \n \n 236  such, was an implicit ch eck on monarchical excess.173 Much like the inculcation of Neo -Confucian \nprograms of self -cultivation to Chos\u014fn monarchs, it was another technique for court officials and \nthe educated elite they represented to circumscribe the authority of the Korean throne.174 In this \nbroad program of reining in the monarch, the excesses and failures of Ming emperors might have \nprovided ready examples to illustrate the validity of their remonstrances. Whereas their literati \ncounterparts in the Ming could only resort on the his torical examples of long dead rulers to \nremonstrate with their own rulers, thanks to likes of Zhengde and Jiajing, Korean court officials \ncould draw on the examples provided by living monarchs.  \nConclusion  \nThe practices described in this chapter worked cons istently through the entire duration of \nChos\u014fn -Ming relations.

In these interactions, a different kind \nof historicity appears, where the diverse actors involved could appropriate existing institutions for \nulterior ends. The ideological, discursive, and social context of t ributary exchange made \nappropriation possible, but in doing so, they also became subject to reinvention. Viewed from the \nbird\u2019s eye, the continuity and regularity of envoy travel appears an unchanging fact of Chos\u014fn -Ming \ndiplomacy; viewed on the ground, however, we see that it was constituted by a host of minute \npractices subject to revision and restructuring. What looks like a s tatic feature was in fact the \ncoalescing of a variety of dynamic processes.  \n                                                 \n173 Robinson, \u201cDisturbing Images,\u201d 110 \u2013114. \n174 JaHyun Kim Haboush, \u201cThe Education of the Yi Crown Prince: A Study in Confucian Pedagogy,\u201d in The Rise of Neo -\nConfucianism in Korea , ed.

The Chos\u014fn court did not collect intelligence about the Ming for curiosity \u2019s sake, but rather \nbecause what it garnered was vital to its activities.  Imperial succession, frontier unrest, or matters of \nKorea \u2019s prestige and position in the Ming court all had consequential implications for Chos\u014fn. \nThese issues were doubly important because Chos\u014f n engaged the Ming on terms of  extreme \nasymmetry. Every single imperial agent its emissaries encountered could potentially ruin a Chos\u014fn \nembassy, but this dynamic did not render Chos\u014fn powerless. Ming policy was rarely unitary and its \nrepresentatives were often disaggregated and dispersed. Awareness of how each disparate part \nfunctioned and investment in ties with different echelons of Ming administration could allow a \nChos\u014fn embassy considerable discretion in moving through its cracks. In other words, inti mate \nknowledge of Ming politics, institutions, and interest could convert asymmetry into an advantage. \nChos\u014fn may have been relative powerless before each, individual imperial agent, but mastering the \nworkings of empire made it extremely effective in the b roader context .175  \nKnowing empire and investing in empire were dialectical. Lateral connections with Ming \nagents, then, can be seen as a form of investment in networks of patrimonial relations. Frequent \nmissions provided the Chos\u014fn court an opportunity to m aintain and upkeep this network, which \nextended beyond Chos\u014fn \u2019s border, well into the Ming capital.

A detailed study of the knowledge exchange between \nChos\u014fn and the Ming will have to await a future study.  \n \n 238  practices, as Chos\u014fn envoys often did, as \u201ccorruption.\u201d But, even they (who were usually quite \nremoved from these activities) tolerated them, and tacitly allowed their underlings, career \ninterpreters to carry them out. It is also poss ible to see these parasitic figures on the tribute route as \npotential allies or sources of valuable information. For those who had to carry out the day -to-day \nbusiness of an embassy, it was this systemic \u201ccorruption\u201d that made a successful envoy mission \npossible. In sum, these phenomena, far from aberrations, were essential for the regular operations of \nan envoy mission and its dual purpose of diplomacy and intelligence.  \nThis is not to discount the role of envoy missions as diplomatic ritual. They certainly  \ncontributed to maintaining peaceable relations with the Ming. Envoy missions were one among a \n\u201crange of flexible institutional and discursive tools with which to resolve conflicts,\u201d the tributary \nsystem provided. Chos\u014fn missions signaled normality to the Ming, but, as the only substantive form \nof sustained contact, also quite literally constituted normality through its performance of hierarchy. \nThe enduring peace the Ming and Chos\u014fn enjoyed then cannot be attributed simply to the Ming \u2019s \n\u201ccommitment not to exploit.\u201d176  \nWhile it has now been a truism that the Ming court larg ely left Chos\u014fn to its own devi ces in \ndomestic affairs, such a result was not a natural outgrowth of something inherent to interstate \nrelations in East Asia nor to the Chinese imperial trad ition. The Ming founder in theory guaranteed \nKorean sovereignty and listed Korea (and many other neighboring states) among the \u201ccountries that \nshould never be invaded,\u201d the value of these assurances were dubious, especially when his son, the \nYongle emperor , violated this injunction. Hindsight allows us to see these centuries as time of \nenduring peace, but from the vantage of Chos\u014fn actors, there was little guarantee of such a result. \nThere is no way to know what would have happened if the Chos\u014fn court cease d its envoy missions \n                                                 \n176 Kang, East Asian b efore the", "doc_id": "2e057b16-97e5-4d18-bf5a-0791d1d60913", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "7106d5347408a2fc69815ecf193c838af51f2a72124c9df9e613ca29436d35b1", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 709958, "end": 713070}, "relationships": {"1": "f47394fe-94c7-4ac0-a316-a92b37a55a86", "2": "3c66187c-a75b-4275-ac14-c536d9a6164f", "3": "0f5abd56-5464-4766-97f8-0752c65d5853"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "0f5abd56-5464-4766-97f8-0752c65d5853": {"__data__": {"text": "would have happened if the Chos\u014fn court cease d its envoy missions \n                                                 \n176 Kang, East Asian b efore the West , 62\u201368. \n \n 239  and did not constantly remind the Ming of its commitment to moral empire and non -intervention.  \nThe absence of direct intervention, instead, was at least partially related to Chos\u014fn \u2019s careful \nmanagement of this relationship, not least o f all through an exploitation of its asymmetrical dynamic.  \nEver since Fairbank \u2019s The Chinese World Order, there is also a tendency to conflate the \n\u201ctributary system\u201d with the political designs prerogatives of imperial China. Given that the Chos\u014fn \ncourt inv ested enormously in its upkeep, such a view is extremely reductive. At the very least for the \nperiod in question, the Chos\u014fn court co -constructed with the Ming its basic institutions, if not most \nof the burden for sustaining its operations. The Chos\u014fn also  saw the \u201ctributary system\u201d as a \n\u201clegitimate institution,\u201d but that legitimacy did not derive from it being a Chinese invention or its \nimperial use.177 The extensive documentation of realpolitik  considerations and the frequent, often \ncandid, appraisals of Mi ng politics ought to dispel any misconception that the Koreans viewed the \nMing court as an inherently moral institution.  The tributary system, its rules, and its principles were \nlegitimate, along with the Confucian discourse that described it, but in Korea n eyes, the legitimacy of \nthe Ming, the tributary system, along with those of the Chos\u014fn court itself derived from the same \nuniversal principles.  \nAppeals to and the performance of ideals of empire did not automatically translate into a \nwholesale worship of  things Ming (or Chinese), despite Korean declarations to that effect in \nnumerous diplomatic dispatches and letters. Conversesly, critiques of Ming rule and practices in \nenvoy reports should not be read as Korean rejection of ritual hierarchy, or even of t he Ming itself. \nNeither wayward emperors nor their uncouth agents undermined these ideals, but rather served as \nnegative models of what things ought to be. The critiques themselves echoed an ideal of empire and \nthe moral injunctions of proper Confucian gov ernance.

He transmitted \nroyal orders on behalf of his ailing father King Sejong \u4e16\u5b97  (r. 1418 \u20131450) and carried out \nimportant ritual function s as the most senior member of the royal family when his older brother, \nKing Munjong \u6587\u5b97 ", "doc_id": "c6b692ac-6dce-46e0-a509-a6707003b06a", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "cd659b4c8a7920fca66d3b6503f696221e2a2a06904a0446cab6926183dbc414", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 716101, "end": 719058}, "relationships": {"1": "f47394fe-94c7-4ac0-a316-a92b37a55a86", "2": "0f5abd56-5464-4766-97f8-0752c65d5853", "3": "e5e16621-1e86-46ca-ae44-0aa3b920d6ab"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "e5e16621-1e86-46ca-ae44-0aa3b920d6ab": {"__data__": {"text": "prominent well before his accession to the throne.

The Veritable Records  (Tanjong sillok 7:25b [1453/09/25#1]; 8:5b \u20138:9a [1453/10/10#1]) suggest that \nSuyang \u2019s actions were in fa ct to prevent Hwangbo and Kim from seizing power themselves, which is possible.

This perspective is more or less embedded in \ncontemporary scholarship as well. It is best, however, to avoid such easy dichotomies when discussing the intrigues of \ncourt politics from a serious historiographical perspective.

The  gesture of recognition appears to be pro forma, a \nforegone conclusion.7 \nSuyang \u2019s use of diplomacy went beyond acquiring symbols of legitimacy through the  rite of \ninvestiture. He also made use of the whole gamut of techniques available to the Chos\u014fn court. He \ncultivated lateral relations with Ming officials and crafted tailored representations of both his \nkingship and his country. Suyang and his supporters converted asymmetries of power and \nknowledge into political initiative and exploited diplomacy for their own political goals. A coup d \u2019\u00e9tat \nfrom within, Suyang \u2019s accession had everything to do with exploiting diplomatic channels to his \nadvantage. Foreign r elations, in this case, was part and parcel of a contest for domestic power.  \nSuyang \u2019s strategic use of established diplomatic institutions for partisan benefit and his \nability to maneuver the mechanics of power in the Ming institutions caution against the  reading of \nChos\u014fn -Ming relations only in terms of state level interactions.8 Suyang \u2019s achievements certainly \nreflected existing strategies and are useful illustrations of the mechanisms of interchange between \nthe Ming and Chos\u014fn courts, but they should no t simply be read as a reflection of so -called \n\u201ctributary relations\u201d at work. Instead of arguing for the representativeness of Suyang \u2019s case as \nillustrations of a \u201csystem,\u201d this chapter will examine how various contingencies came together with \nexisting prac tices, and ultimately shaped later practice. It treats diplomatic practice not as an \nunchanging modus operandi that followed fixed rules, but an evolving set of practical repertoires.  \n                                                 \n7 Investiture and proclamations were seen, by the late Ming, to be routine gestures. \u201cAll matters of importance\u201d were to \nbe", "doc_id": "fda31bad-dfa9-428b-b820-c98eec83d435", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "73b1371bba865c1652106c34baf656442393f0efa55c949fed118200cbaab371", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 723863, "end": 726405}, "relationships": {"1": "f47394fe-94c7-4ac0-a316-a92b37a55a86", "2": "b95727b9-fc52-442e-8534-7e1e9b2192d8", "3": "e5967eb9-3f1b-4a56-aefe-5547c3b64e8f"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "e5967eb9-3f1b-4a56-aefe-5547c3b64e8f": {"__data__": {"text": "                                         \n7 Investiture and proclamations were seen, by the late Ming, to be routine gestures. \u201cAll matters of importance\u201d were to \nbe announced to the Korean kingdom of Chos\u014fn and the Ming sent an envoy to announce matters rel ated to imperial \nsuccession.

In 1450, the Ming throne in Beijing briefly sat empty; the Mongol commander Esen Taishi \ncaptured the Yingzong emperor ( \u82f1\u5b97  r. 1436 \u20131449,  1457 \u20131464) after the destruction of the Ming \narmy in Tumu ( Tumu zhi bian \u571f\u6728\u4e4b\u8b8a ). The Ming court, led by the War Minister Yu Qian \u4e8e\u8b19  \n(1398 \u20131457) installed Yingzong \u2019s younger brother on the throne as the Jingtai emperor ( \u666f\u6cf0\u5e1d  r. \n1450 \u20131457). In 1450, the Ming dispatched Ni Qian ( \u502a\u8b19  ?\u20131479) to announce the sudden \naccession of the Jingtai emperor. When he arrived, neither the Chos\u014fn king, Sejong, nor his crown \nprince (later King Munjong \u6587\u5b97  r. 1450 \u20131452) were ready to receive him. When told they were \nbedridden wit h illness, the envoy grew suspicious, fearing that  Chos\u014fn may \u201charbor a second heart\u201d \nbecause of what he had termed, rather euphemistically, the Ming court \u2019s recent \u201cincidents.\u201d His \nworries that Chos\u014fn would renounce its loyalty to the Ming were soon allay ed, once Prince Suyang \ncame to welcome the envoy at the head of the other royal princes.9 Esen returned Yingzong to the \nMing court, but the former emperor was sequestered in virtual house arrest.

Ni Qian \u2019s travelogue took pains to document the names and \nranks of the various members of the Chos\u014fn court who welcomed him. As Philip de Heer explains, Ni \u2019s attentive \ndocumentation was related to the sensitive circ umstances accompanying the accession of the Jingtai emperor. Since \nproclamations of imperial accession were supposed to be accepted in person by Korean rulers, Ni \u2019s failure to meet the \nking placed the envoy in difficult straits. An envoy had proclaim the i mperial edict to the proper recipient, on pain of \ndeath, as one Ming envoy to Champa would discover in 1481. He had neglected to find the Champa ruler and \nproclaimed the edict to his nobles. Hewas accused of deceiving the imperial court and was summarily e xecuted. Ni, by \nshowing that the Chos\u014fn court took pains to attend to matters of protocol and that Suyang in fact represented the \nthrone, may have absolved himself of potential accusations of dereliction.

Dynastic upheaval was a source of insecurity for \nboth courts, but it also offered a valuable opportunity for Prince Suyang to actualize his political \nambitions.

Not only did \nSuyang exploit diplomacy to take power, but he also did so while successfully concealing his \nquestionable legitima cy from the Ming court. This conspicuous omission in sources like the Ming \nVeritable Records parallels the situation for oth er major political intrigues in the Chos\u014fn court. After a \ncoup  removed Y\u014fnsangun and placed Chungjong on the throne in 1506, the Chos\u014fn court under \nthe control of the conspirators went to great lengths to secure the support of Ming officials and \npalace eun uchs, all to ensure a document of investiture would be granted to the new king.

The effort to portray Prince \nSuyang \u2019s rise as inevitable is clear. The hagiographic account certainly should not be taken at face \nvalue, but as political encomiums go, few of the individual elements of the narrative are particularly \nremarkable in and of themselves. The ritual decorum of Chos\u014fn envoys was a common trope in \nenvoy accounts. Other Korean visitors behaved just as well in t he eyes of Ming officials.23. What \ndistinguishes this account of Suyang  from the others is how its narrative elements were linked to the \nconstruction of kingship. From behaving with due ritual deference, to showing benevolent \nleadership, to, most importantl y, eliciting the awe of all those who came in contact with him, Suyang \nwas in every way, in the words of a Ming envoy to Suyang \u2019s court in 1460, five years after his \naccession, a \u201cwise king\u201d of Chos\u014fn.24 One need not believe that even elephants could recognize \nSuyang \u2019s gleaming virtue and certain destiny to see how such narratives construct royal authority. \nWhether these accounts we re wholesale fabrications to justify seizure of the throne, or exaggerated \nportrayals of actual deeds in China, only matter to a point \u2014both were mechanisms of self -\nconstruction that rested on a similar symbolic logic.

Returning seven months after Suyang, the leader of \nanother embassy to the Ming led by Yi Inson \u674e\u4ec1\u5b6b  (1395 \u20131463) related words of apology from \nthe Korean eunuch Yun Pong \u5c39\u9cf3  (?\u20131483) who worked at the Ming court.

This ambiguity may also explain the slippages of identit y described in the first account of \nthe mission.  \nThe account of the mission makes no indication that Suyang was slighted by Ming officials. \nFrom border military officials to capital ministers, none seemed the least bit derelict in their \ntreatment. Another possibility for what Yun Pong and the Ming emperor might have meant then, \nwas that the court did not treat Suyang according to precedents reserved for the Korean rulers or \ntheir heirs apparent. Ming ritual regulations had specific provisions for entertaini ng personal tribute \nmissions (Ch: qinchao \u89aa\u671d ) by foreign monarchs. Unlike their Kory\u014f predecessors, Chos\u014fn kings \nnever pursued personal audiences with emperors, but they did occasionally send their princes as \nenvoys in gestures of fealty.28 Before Suyang, s everal Chos\u014fn princes went to the Ming to present \ntribute, but only T \u2019aejong \u2019s heir apparent Prince Yangny\u014fng ( \u8b93\u5be7\u5927\u541b , 1394 \u20131462), who went in \n1408, received exceptional treatment from the Ming. T \u2019aejong had gone to the Ming as well in 1396, \nbut because he w as not an heir apparent, he was treated no differently than other Korean \nemissaries.29 Without the necessary credentials or regalia, Suyang could not have openly claimed to \nbe the heir to the Chos\u014fn throne to enjoy this level of treatment. However, had Suya ng wanted to \ncultivate a royal aura, the ambiguity of his identity would have offered ample room for willful, if \noblique, misrepresentation.30 \n                                                 \n28 Ch\u014fng Tonghun \u912d\u6771\u52f3 , \u201cMy\u014fngdae \u016di yeje chils\u014f es\u014f Chos\u014fn kugwang \u016di wisang \uba85\ub300\uc758  \uc608\uc81c  \uc9c8\uc11c\uc5d0\uc11c  \n\uc870\uc120\uad6d\uc655\uc758  \uc704\uc0c1 ,\u201d Y\u014fksa wa hy\u014fnsil  84 (Ju ne 2012): 251 \u201392. \n29 T\u2019aejong sillok  18:10a [1409/08/10#1]; 15:13a \u201317b [1408/04/02#1 \u201318].

Traveling with a larger than usual entourage as \na Chos\u014fn prince could foster additional fanfare and spectacle and provide much food for rumor and \nspeculation among Ming officials, commoners, and Jurchen tribute -bearers. With out certain \nknowledge of protocols surrounding past precedents and Suyang \u2019s diplomatic credentials, few would \nhave been privy to the exact identity of the Chos\u014fn prince.31 That Suyang was mistakenly called \n\u201cwang\u201d  and \u201c dianxia ,\u201d was not surprising. Ming offi cial hesitation in ceremonial preparation and the \nslippage in modes of address could both result from and compound these ambiguities. The \nanecdotes of royal recognition then may not simply be discursive fabrications, but the intended \nresult of manipulated social situations. Neither verbatim transcripts of fact nor outright fabrications, \nthese accounts are more likely artifacts of a subtle interplay between textual construction and self -\nfashioning. The accounts are thus likely embellishments of actual events , themselves the outcomes \nof staged gestures and intentional equivocation.  \nAll possible readings converge on the importance of Suyang \u2019s mission for constructing his \nlegitimacy and the political opportunities diplomacy provided. If we believe the account, then \nSuyang, through the performance of virtue and his disciplined behavior, arrogated unto himself a \nregal aura. His coup d \u2019\u00e9tat was transformed into a political and historical necessity, an event that \ndestroyed his wily, usurping rivals to secure the thr one for its rightful claimant. If we do not, his \nbrush -wielding aides invented these stories to promote an identical narrative. But, even as wholesale \nfabrications, they only underscore the symbolic importance of the same tropes, only in \nhistoriographical representation. Symbolic manipulation on that plane ultimately shares the poetic \nlogic that would have informed Suyang \u2019s social performance.

Accounts of his mission and of Suyang \u2019s sustained contact with Ming officials suggest that \ndiplomacy  also provided an opportunity for cultivating lateral ties to secure Ming approval for his \neventual accession.  \nKorean -born eunuchs were important poin ts of contact for the Chos\u014fn. Sent as human \ntribute to the Ming palace as young boys, some rose to positions of prominence in the Ming palace. \nFrom the Yongle period onward, the Ming court also dispatched them as envoys to their native land. \nTheir role in diplomacy was not limited to envoy missions to Korea; they also served as points of \ncontact for Ming embassies. In the fifteenth century, it was common for Chos\u014fn envoys to be feted \nat the residences of Korean -born eunuchs.32 The account of Suyang \u2019s embassy  related events at \nseveral banquets held in Suyang \u2019s honor at the Ming, but there was no mention of his reception by \nKorean eunuchs. The absence is conspicuous, given that contact between emissaries and the palace \neunuchs were sanctioned by long -standing p recedent. Other Korean emissaries, such as Yi Inson \nwho went several months later, were feted at the residence of Yun Pong, the highest -ranking Korean \neunuch at the Ming court.

At the same \ntime, the account deployed the tropes of recognition used in its treatment of Suyang \u2019s embassy to \nagain construct a sense of royal predestination.

When Suyang left \nBeijing, the Jurchens who had come to the Ming to pay tribute also began to disperse abruptly.

When the Ming emissaries told Suyang this version of the events, he confirmed that he \nhad indeed put down this impe nding rebellion. The timing of those events, however, suggests that \nthere was more to it. Suyang only moved against his enemies months after his return. If the Ming \nenvoys \u2019 account is to be believed, the timing suggested that the Jurchens had foreknowledge  of the \nimpending contest between Suyang and his enemies.37 \nThere are several ways to read this temporal discrepancy. The first is simply to accept the \nTanjong Records at its word: that An \u2019py\u014fng, Hwangbo In and Kim Chongs\u014f \u2019s ambitions were so \ntransparent that the Jurchens and the Ming court could know them in advance (thus conveniently \njustifying Suyang \u2019s seizure of power). The problem again is a question of knowledge: how would this \ninforma tion have gotten into the hands of Jurchen tribute -bearers? Two other possibilities resolve \nthis conundrum. Though they go against the grain of the narrative, they are more likely. One is that \nthe source of this information was none other than Suyang \u2019s own  embassy. Suyang \u2019s entourage, who \nhad kept frequent contact with Jurchen tribute -bearers throughout their trip, could have easily \ndisseminated information to serve his cause. If this had been the case, the rumor must have been \nspread surreptitiously, given  that the sons of Hwangbo In and Kim Chongs\u014f had accompanied \nSuyang on this mission. The other possibility is that the Ming envoys only learned the details of the \ncoup d \u2019\u00e9tat after they arrived in Chos\u014fn. Eager to curry favor with the new power -holder in C hos\u014fn, \nthey repeated Suyang \u2019s own narrative justifying his rise.  \nRegardless of how the Ming eunuchs came to learn of Suyang \u2019s political ascendancy, the fact \nremains that by the time of their meeting, their interpretation conveniently coincided with Suyang \u2019s \nversion. Suyang and the Ming eunuchs were probably colluding. Evidence to the effect is indirect, \nsince we cannot know how much these Ming emissaries actually knew of Suyang \u2019s coup d \u2019\u00e9tat.

Its warnings to Tanjong point to  their reservations \nover his  sudden request. But, the se doubts meant little; Suyang was already firmly in control by the \ntime the \u201crequest\u201d had reached Beijing. Whatever the Ming Board of Rites and the palace eunuchs \nhad k nown about Suyang \u2019s usurpation at the moment, there is no evidence of that knowledge exist \nin extant Ming records. The Ming Veritable Records mentions a request for abdication and the \nimperial court \u2019s subsequent approval, but demonstrated no awareness of t he momentous and violent \npolitical events that led to Suyang \u2019s rise.48 In Ming official consciousness, for all intents and \npurposes, the coup d \u2019\u00e9tat had never happened.  \nMing permission for abdication was not enough.

This lacuna is present in all other Ming historical accounts. \nFor example, see the Shuyu zhouzi lu 1:10a. It should be emphasized that the drafters of edicts and the executioners  of \ndiplomacy were in fact different agencies. While the Ming Board of Rites issued the documents, the imperial agents were \nMing eunuchs, under the direct employment of the emperor. Winning over palace eunuchs did not guarantee support \nfrom the Board of Ri tes, and vice -versa. But, with the support of the palace eunuchs and control over the channel of \ninformation to the Ming, the Board of Rites would have no grounds to deny Tanjong \u2019s requests.  \n49 Gari Keith Ledyard, \u201cThe Korean Language Reform of 1446: The Or igin, Background, and Early History of the \nKorean Alphabet\u201d (Ph.D. Diss, University of California, Berkeley., 1966), 81 \u201384. \n50 Ni Qian, Liaohai bian \u907c\u6d77\u7de8  f.2:22b, p.565; f.2:26a \u201330a, pp. 572 \u2013580, etc., in Yin Mengxia \u6bb7\u5922\u971e  and Yu Hao \n\u4e8e\u6d69 , eds., Shi Chaoxian lu \u4f7f\u671d\u9bae\u9304  (Beijing: Beijing tushuguan chuban she, 2003).  \n \n 263  Sin Sukchu did not disappoint.

He thus made the \nmost of available Korean connections with the Ming court to secure his political position. The \nbounds o f interest and power transcended state -centered loyalties when these human networks \nbrought them together.

Throughout h is reign as King Sejo, he exploited the same \ndynamics of asymmetry that enabled his accession. How he used diplomacy before and after taking \nthe throne rested on the same institutional foundations. The strategy relied on maintaining regular \ncontact with va rious rungs of the Ming bureaucracy. Each layer supplied valuable information, \nwhich could then be dispatched through a tightly -managed waystation system that allowed for its \nrapid transmission. The converse of this was to maintain control of outgoing info rmation through \ncareful self -representation. The intimate relationship between information and diplomacy remained \npivotal for Sejo.  \nThe Chos\u014fn generally sought peaceable relations with the Ming, but they were fraught with \ncontroversy during Sejo \u2019s reign.

He dispersed the tribute -bearing Jurchen leaders, sending them away from the capital as \nsoon a s possible, so that their presence would not rouse the envoy \u2019s suspicions.78 Sejo had no \ninclination of giving into Ming demands straight away, and sought to carefully balance relations with \nthe Ming court and his political ties to the Jianzhou Jurchens.79 \nMing accounts of Sejo \u2019s reception of Chen portrayed the Chos\u014fn king as a docile vassal who \nreadily \u201cadmitted his faults in trepidation.\u201d80 This impression left in Ming records owed to Sejo \u2019s \nstrategic self -representation, for the Chos\u014fn court annals paints an entirely different picture. Chos\u014fn \nking and his court carefully strategized their reception of the Ming embassy throughout. It is clear \nfrom Korean sources that Chos\u014fn had actively sought contacts with the Jurchens. In policy \ndiscussions, they decided enticing \u201cthe submissio n of the Jurchens\u201d was \u201cthe best strategy\u201d for \nmanaging the frontier. When asked about the matter by a Ming envoy, Sejo offered an entirely \ndifferent portrayal of Chos\u014fn policy.81 He denied that Chos\u014fn had any agency in Jurchen dealings:  \nThese people [i.e.  the Jurchen leaders] have the faces of men but the hearts of beasts. If we do allow \nthem [to come to us], they will certainly instigate border conflicts. We had no choice but to treat them \nthis way. They came of their own accord.82 \n \nHumbling himself before  Chen Jiayou, Sejo explained that he was helpless. Chen requested that Sejo \nreport the names of Jurchen leaders who received Korean titles; when Sejo offered them, he \nreceived assurances from Chen that the Ming will \u201corder\u201d the Jurchen leaders to refrain f rom \ncontacting Chos\u014fn in the future.83 \n                                                 \n78 Sejo sillok  15:23a [1459/03/17#1].  \n79 Sejo sillok  15:22b [1459/03/14#4].  \n80 From Chen Jiayou \u2019s obituary in the Xianzong shilu  \u61b2\u5b97\u5be6\u9304  f.47, p. 969 [Chenghua 3, 1467/10]: \u7448\u60f6\u6050\u4f0f\u7f6a . \n81 Sejo sillok  15:24b", "doc_id": "5d6c9c88-444c-4fca-816e-b86963b328d9", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "beb5c43ad511fda8f2cce40c30051c95d8ffc95bb721362f500d8856a0f3eee2", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 795666, "end": 798274}, "relationships": {"1": "f47394fe-94c7-4ac0-a316-a92b37a55a86", "2": "b8fa3c30-b7a8-46bf-b087-705f3fe7000d", "3": "c5327ab1-790c-429e-8526-7cd03077e8b1"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "c5327ab1-790c-429e-8526-7cd03077e8b1": {"__data__": {"text": "\n80 From Chen Jiayou \u2019s obituary in the Xianzong shilu  \u61b2\u5b97\u5be6\u9304  f.47, p. 969 [Chenghua 3, 1467/10]: \u7448\u60f6\u6050\u4f0f\u7f6a . \n81 Sejo sillok  15:24b [1459/03/25].  \n82 \u6b64\u8f29\u4eba\u9762\u7378\u5fc3  \u82e5\u4e0d\u8a31\u4f86  \u537d\u751f\u908a\u91c1  \u4e0d\u5f97\u5df2\u800c\u5f85\u4e4b  \u6709\u81ea\u4f86\u77e3 . \n83 Sejo sillok 16:1b [1459/04/08#1].  \n \n 272  Sejo also reinforced an image of docility in his memorial to the Ming.

Chos\u014fn \u2019s Jurchen policy indeed exhibited a gradual, but noticeable retrenchment after these \ninterventions. By the early sixteenth century, Jurchen tribute bearers no longer assembled en masse  at \nthe Chos\u014fn capital, even as Jurchen affairs remained a concern for the Chos\u014fn frontier.86 These \nchanges, however, cannot be attributed to the effectiveness of embassies such as Chen \u2019s, but rather \nto the structural changes that accompanied the decline of Jurchen power in the late fifteenth \ncentury.87 The image of a docile Korean king in the Ming rec ords was a temporary fiction, a result \nof strategic performance.

The affair escalated when Sejo captured and executed a recalcitrant leader, Lang \nParahan (\u6d6a\u5b5b\u5152\u7f55  ? \u20131459) , after luring him to Chos\u014fn with promise of titles and gifts. Lang \nParahan \u2019s subordinates begged for leniency, reminding the Chos\u014fn that he \u201creceived high rank from \nChina,\u201d and served the Ming as the Assistant Commissioner -in-chief  of the Maolian garrison .89 \nFully aware of his connections to the Ming, the Chos\u014fn authorities had him executed anyway.90 Sejo \nopenly flouted Ming warnin gs against contact with Jurchens.  \nLang Parahan \u2019s followers reported the incident to the Ming and portrayed it as a direct \naffront  to Ming authority. The Ming responded by dispatching another embassy to Chos\u014fn, led this \ntime by Zhang Ning and assisted by a Jurchen -born military officer of the Embroidered Guard \nknown for his valor. Again, the purpose, timetable, and identities of the Ming envoys were \ndiscovered by another Chos\u014fn embassy traveling through the Ming at the time. Although the Ming \nkept the mission a secret and did not disclose it ( \u79d8\u4e0d\u767c ), Sejo learned of Zhang \u2019s mission only \ntwelve days after his departure from Beijing. Sejo  ordered his officials to \u201cdeal with this emissary the \nway [they] had dealt with Chen Jiayou.\u201d91 \n                                                 \n88 The geographical region is the frontier zone formed by the Tumen and Douman Rivers between modern Hamgy\u014fng \nProvince in North Korea and Jilin Province in Ch ina. \n89 Ch: Maolian wei Dudujianshi \u6bdb\u6190\u885b\u90fd\u7763\u50c9\u4e8b . \n90 For Sejo \u2019s execution of the Maolian chief and the court \u2019s knowledge of his connections with the Ming see Sejo sillok \n17:15a [1459/08/23#]; see also Woodruff, \u201cForeign Policy and Frontier Affairs Along the Ming Northeast,\u201d 167 \u2013168. \n91 Sejo sillok  19:11b [1460/02/04#1].

The edict \nZhang proclaimed was sympathetic to Sejo \u2019s position. It merely inquir ed whether the accusations of \nthe Maolian Jurchens were true. Asking the Chos\u014fn king to \u201cunderstand My intentions,\u201d the \nimperial voice implored Sejo to \u201cnot cover up anything at all\u201d so as to stem escalating hostilities. \nThe envoy, on the other hand, went to the crux of the matter and demanded that Sejo explain \nhimself for \u201cwantonly killing\u201d a high -ranking imperial officer. In the course of their discussion, Sejo \nnever acknowledged this point, but explained that Lang Parahan was in fact \u201ca person of [his] \ncountry\u201d and killing him was no different from executing a common criminal. In the course of this \nconversation, Zhang Ning ultimately relented and assured the king that the imperial court was only \nconcerned with maintaining peace for Chos\u014fn \u2019s sake.  \nZhang Ni ng had initially shown himself to be dutiful, incorruptible and somewhat officious. \nHe paid detailed attention to matters of ritual and refused the many gifts prepared for him. Sejo\u2019s \npersonal meeting with Zhang dramatically softened the envoy \u2019s approach. In the course of their \nconversations, Zhang dismissed the Korean interpreter, finding his linguistic skills inadequate (or, \nmore likely, he feared that the interpreter was dissembling for the King). Zhang asked the king to \nspeak to him directly in writing.  The king \u2019s attendants prepared the stationery, and the two \ncontinued their intercourse on paper. In the middle of this exchange, Sejo expressed his desire to \nsend Korean students to study in the Ming and declared his unwavering loyalty to the emperor.92 \nSejo\u2019s eloquence, his lavish gifts, and the erudite company of Chos\u014fn \u2019s court scholars, eventually \ncoaxed the Ming envoy to relax his initially rigid stance.93  \n                                                 \n92 Sejo sillok  19:26a [1460/03/02#1]: \u4e0a\u66f0 : \u6211\u5c0f\u90a6\u656c \u4e8b\u671d\u5ef7  \u81f3\u8aa0\u7121\u8cb3  \u6211\u570b\u908a\u6c11  \u7686\u8056\u7687\u5e1d\u8d64\u5b50  \u82e5\u898b\u4fb5\u66b4  \u671d\u5ef7\n\u5b89\u5f97\u605d\u7136 ? \n93 For gifts see Sejo sillok  19:34a [1460/03/08#3]; 19:35a [1460/03/09#3]; for Sejo convincing the envoy to tarry, along \nwith the banquets and entertainment, see 19:31b", "doc_id": "46e3b322-aacd-4eda-be2e-1f04e6778082", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "9fbded533d531c2068d32f24be49eef947fe435a37c1a7c15642061268119486", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 803113, "end": 805725}, "relationships": {"1": "f47394fe-94c7-4ac0-a316-a92b37a55a86", "2": "37e5ea68-dc35-44a3-b21d-63df31f15265", "3": "1b1970f8-579f-4342-afe4-0934452039bb"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "1b1970f8-579f-4342-afe4-0934452039bb": {"__data__": {"text": "? \n93 For gifts see Sejo sillok  19:34a [1460/03/08#3]; 19:35a [1460/03/09#3]; for Sejo convincing the envoy to tarry, along \nwith the banquets and entertainment, see 19:31b [1460/03/04#2].  \n \n 275  Zhang and Sejo agreed to draft their memorials in mutual consultation. Zhang asked to see \nthe drafts of several Chos\u014fn memorials before he approved of the final version.94 Zhang also \ncomposed his own memorial, which explained that the Chos\u014fn king \u201ctruly did not know that [the \nJurchen chief] had received an office [from the Ming]\u201d and vouched for the king \u2019s honesty and \nsincerity.

It made no mention of Chos\u014fn \u2019s prior \nknowledge of Lang Parahan \u2019s Ming titles. These two memorials worked together to sides tep the \nproblem of Chos\u014fn infringement on Ming sovereign claims. Zhang Ning, whether he was aware of \nit or not, had abetted Sejo in covering up the incident. The conspicuous declaration that \u201cnothing \nwas concealed or embellished\u201d really pointed to the cont rary: much was in fact concealed and \nembellished. The final reports submitted to the Ming court was a co -production between the Ming \nliterati and the Korean king.

After Zhang \u2019s departure, and despite Ming entreaties for peace, he immediately \nresumed hostilities with the Uryangkhai. Later in 1460, Sejo learned that another Ming envoy was \ntraveling to Maolian to implore the Uryangkhai to make peace with Chos\u014fn. He offered to send an \narmed escort ostensibly to protect the Ming envoy. An overt gesture of good will, Sejo i n fact \nplanned to use the envoy as bait. He arranged for the main body of his army to travel near envoy \u2019s \nentourage. Hoping that the Maolian leaders would assemble to hear the imperial edict, he wanted to \nuse the opportunity to ambush them and eliminate th em once and for all.99 The Ming envoy, \nhowever, departed earlier than anticipated, leaving  no time for the main Chos\u014fn army to reach their \npositions. Sejo \u2019s conspiracy had failed.100  \nThe Ming could express its displeasure or dispatch envoys to chastise Sejo for defying their \norders, but the vendetta with the Maolian was to be pursued in spite of th em. As Sejo \u2019s adviser Sin \nSukchu suggested, \u201cif the emperor sends edicts,\u201d one only need to answer for the time being that \none \u201cwill reverently obey the Sagely command.\u201d If opportunities for military action should arise \nlater, Ming orders could still be fl outed, for there was \u201cno need to fret for the lack of words\u201d in \nresponses to Ming inquiries.

It would be dangerous to generalize from this particular moment and the political \nstrategies of o ne very remarkable king. Sejo was, perhaps, unique among Chos\u014fn rulers for his \nability and willingness to manipulate the institutions of empire for his own ends. Part of this can \nattributed to Sejo \u2019s own experience with diplomacy prior to taking throne. Un til the nineteenth \ncentury, no other Chos\u014fn ruler ever stepped outside of Korea during their lifetimes.102 His \nattentiveness to diplomacy may only be rivaled by one other early Chos\u014fn ruler, Chungjong (1506 \u2013\n1544), who too also came to power via a  coup d \u2019\u00e9tat and struggled with lingering questions over his \nlegitimacy.  \nAs he orchestrated his court \u2019s interactions with Ming envoys, Sejo was exceedingly generous \nwith them. In spite of frequent protests by his courtiers against all -too-frequent envoy trips that \nburdened Chos\u014fn \u2019s waystations, Sejo generally spared no expense in lavishly entertaining imperial \nambassadors.103 Perhaps his vulnerable legitimacy made it doubly important to maintain friendly ties \nwith Ming ambassadors and to preserve an image of himself as a n ever dutiful vassal, for a \nrelationship gone awry posed acute risks for his kingship.  \nOn the other hand relations with the Ming, when managed well, offered numerous \nadvantages. Most of these, such as political legitimacy and access to metropolitan goods and culture, \n                                                 \n\u5247\u4ea6\u4f55\u60a3\u7121\u8fad ?

Sejo was remarkable among Korean rulers only in that he \nsucceeded in claiming them even before his accession. Yet, this manner of manipulation was not \nremarkable in and of itself. Imperial connections ha d long been appropriated by nearly any party \nwho was involved with tributary trade and envoy exchange. Noble -born courtier -envoys, \ninterpreters, and military officers, erstwhile agents of the king, all made use of their access to accrue \nprestige, wealth, a nd political power.104 All this was done in the name of revering imperial authority \nby \u201cServing the Great\u201d in diplomacy. If a Chos\u014fn king could borrow the authority of empire to \nachieve its own ends, then his officials could borrow the demands diplomacy to achieve their own \nends as well.  \nThe Chos\u014fn court did not in fact monopolize control over its own diplomacy, though it \nsought to maintain one.105 The very connections that Sejo had exploited to seize and consolidate his \npower, had, by the reign of his grandson become a political liability. With the death of a particularly \nsavvy and strong -willed ruler like Sejo, few other Chos\u014fn kings maneuvered the structures Sejo \nhelped foster with equal deftness. Good will from imperial envoys could be nurtured with favors \nand gifts, but their demands could become excessive. A direct channel of communication to the \nMing inner court through Korean -born eunuchs was useful, but expensive to maintain.

Increased private \ntrade by tribute envoys and their entourages meant that local corv\u00e9e labor had to shoulder the \nburden of transportation. Members of the tribute embassy regularly abused these public resources \nfor their private gain. S\u014fngjong \u2019s court tried to rein in the smuggling, but the court often relied on \nthe same individuals for enforcement. When King S\u014fngjong instigated a crackdown on the \nsmuggling, he found the envoys he appointed to be among the chief offenders.109 Interpreters  and \nother members of the entourage who smuggled goods too were often acting at the behest of \nvenerable high officials, including for example, the famous compiler of the Literary Selections of the \nEast, S\u014f K\u014fj\u014fng.110 \nThese attempts at managing diplomacy coul d be seen as the court\u2019s attempt to  monopolize \nthe access to the material (and, potentially the ideological and cultural) resources that tribute -trade \noffered. When trying to curtail the abuse of the corv\u00e9e transport system, experienced diplomats, \nsuch as Sin Sukchu, reminded the king that successful diplomacy required the use of bribes to \ncultivate \u201chuman feelings\u201d ( inj\u014fng \u4eba\u60c5 ) between the various parties involved.111 Private smuggling, \nextortion, and the appropriation of public resources had become endemic to the practice of envoy \nexchange.

They were also all vulnerable to Chos\u014fn manipulation. \nWhen Sejo went to China as an envoy, he usurped both the royal court \u2019s diplomatic prerogative and \nthe narrative ingredients o f imperial legitimation. Poaching both to construct his own personal \nmythology as a king -to-be was nonetheless only the most extreme example of appropriation. Viewed \nthis way, the only substantive difference between his actions and those of the envoys and \ninterpreters, whose smuggling activities plagued his grandson \u2019s court, was the extent of their \nambitions.  \nAs part of this process of appropriating empire, King Sejo also played to Ming expectations \nthroug h careful self -representation. Even as  Sejo sought t it-for-tit exchanges of political favors with \nMing eunuchs, to literati Ming envoys, he constructed an image of a loyal vassal, as if drawn straight \nfrom the pages of a Chinese dynastic history. Keen to declare his \u201cloyalty,\u201d he played to imperial \ndesire a nd performed, though only outwardly, the role of an obedient vassal.

In Chos\u014fn, the realpolitik  of the fifteenth century seemed to give way to an \ninternalized \u201cConfucian idealism\u201d of the sixteenth century, as Peter Yun and others have sugg ested. \nLate sixteenth century philosophers like Yi Hwang and Yi I called for Chos\u014fn to consistently \nperform its duties as a loyal vassal to the Ming, but these exhortations to ritual perfection were \nalways embedded in an implicit moral critique of society,  politics, and the imperium itself.113 Within \nthis \u201cConfucian\u201d logic, these exhortations did not necessarily signal subservience to the Ming, but \ninstead asserted the moral agency of the hierarchically inferior, whether it be a local literatus vis -a-vis \nthe state, a court official vis -a-vis th e king, or, in the case of Chos\u014fn, a feudal lord vis -a-vis the \nemperor. Even as being a loyal Ming vassal became more than an image to project to the Ming, and \nwas seen to have normative weight, it did not mean it lost its strategic dimension. It merely op erated  \nalong a different axis.  \nBoth strategic and normative discourses of diplomacy persisted throughout the Chos\u014fn \nperiod, but one way they shifted was in the reification of Korea \u2019s image as an ever -loyal tributary of \nthe Ming. Rather than see this image as a defining feature of Chos\u014fn -Ming relations, it is far better \n                                                 \n113 Peter Yun, \u201cRethinking the Tribute System: Korean States and Northeast Asian Interstate Relations, 600 -1600,\u201d \n204\u2013207; \u201cConfucian Ideology and the Tribute System in Chos\u014fn -Ming Relations,\u201d Sach\u2019ong 55, no. 9 (2002).  \n \n 283  understood as a product of choices made by the participants of this diplomacy.

It was not simply a matter of degree, because his reign also developed an \nentirely novel tec hnology of self -representation, the Brilliant Flowers anthologies ( Hwanghwajip \u7687\u83ef\n\u96c6). These Ming envoy poetry collections were veritable literary monuments to empire, reifying over \ntime an image of Chos\u014fn as the Ming \u2019s most loyal tributary and the Ming as u niversal sovereign. \nBut, behind this most pronounced stereotypes was another story, whose significance will be \ndiscussed in the following two chapters.  \n \n284 Chapter 5  \nBrilliant Are the Flowers: Empire, Civilization, and Sovereign ty in Chos\u014fn -\nMing Envoy Poetry,  1457\u20131592 \nWhether as a prince jockeying for power or as the ruler of Chos\u014fn, King Sejo exploited his \nrelations with the Ming to achieve his own political goals. Utilitarian in in his use of power, Sejo \nrepeatedly disregarded the sanctity of Ming authority  as he augmented his own.1 Sejo also \nchallenged imperial ritual prerogatives by performing heaven -worship rites that were, in theory, \nreserved only to the Ming emperor as the Son of Heaven.2 How should these actions be reconciled \nwith his expressions of al legiance and his otherwise dutiful observance of the obligations of a \u201cvassal \nking?\u201d Were they mere instruments for dealing with the Ming? Sejo might have thought so, \nperceiving his ritual performances and rhetorical declarations as necessary expedients.  \nWithout access to the workings of Sejo \u2019s mind, ascertaining whether these performances \nwere conceived cynically or sincerely is impossible. As this dissertation has argued, the search for \nsincere sentiment distracts from recognizing the illocutionary force of these performances \u2014that is \nto say, the cultural and political work they were to do. On many levels, authentic emotion is \nirrelevant to these questions. First, the performative  quality of ritual instantiates its larger normative \nclaims; the performer may  be transformed by the act, even as he appropriate s its symbols.3 Viewed \nin the long term, repeatedly acting out the gestures of obeisance normalizes and thus legitimizes the \n                                                 \n1 Kim T \u2019aey\u014fng \u91d1\u6cf0\u6c38 , \u201cChos\u014fn ch \u2019ogi Sejo wanggw\u014fn \u016di ch\u014fnches\u014fng e taehan ilkoch \u2019al \u671d\u9bae\ucd08\uae30  \u4e16\u7956\u738b\u6b0a \uc758 \n\u5c08\u5236\u6027\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c  \u4e00\u8003\u5bdf ,\u201d Han\u2019guk sa y\u014fn", "doc_id": "643f497d-7905-44bb-9d65-6e29753d6a94", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "ae52df526f7f654ce2115ed5638d6d9eefd34dc603e173f301590059f41a5abb", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 825469, "end": 828251}, "relationships": {"1": "f47394fe-94c7-4ac0-a316-a92b37a55a86", "2": "3abf1529-42dd-4ddb-966d-9413f6c20614", "3": "27ab1989-3a2b-4e16-b2c5-0bbb5a03cf16"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "27ab1989-3a2b-4e16-b2c5-0bbb5a03cf16": {"__data__": {"text": "\u016di ch\u014fnches\u014fng e taehan ilkoch \u2019al \u671d\u9bae\ucd08\uae30  \u4e16\u7956\u738b\u6b0a \uc758 \n\u5c08\u5236\u6027\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c  \u4e00\u8003\u5bdf ,\u201d Han\u2019guk sa y\u014fn \u2019gu, no. 87 (December 1994): 117 \u201346; Sohn Pow -key, \u201cSocial History of the \nEarly Yi Dynast y 1392 -1592,\u201d 47 \u201348. \n2 Sejo\u2019s father, Sejong, had refused to perform these rites because it was an \u201cusurpation of ritual.\u201d Sejong sillok  34:6b \n[1426/11/07#1]; 101:6b [1443/07/10#3]; 105:9b [1444/07/20#1].

Even if Sejo remained impervious to ritual \u2019s transformative  power, the bulk of \nthe Chos\u014fn elite were born into a world where such rituals were already legitimate. Second, even \ncynical performances (so long as they are convincing) can take on a life of their own, for those who \nencounter them have no reason to doubt  the motivations behind them.4 Ming observers and \nChos\u014fn performers (and vice -versa) had to interact with each other on the field of this ritual, and \nentered into a relationship, an Eliasian figuration, where both parties played to each other \u2019s \nexpectation s. Their diplomatic d eclarations, once uttered, and their rituals once performed, existed \non a separate communicative plane, taking on a life of their own.  Specific discourses and practices \nthen became objects of symbolic contestation, often in ways that e xceeded the confines of their \noriginal purpose.  \nThe Brilliant Flowers  anthologies ( Hwanghwajip \u7687\u83ef\u96c6 ) and their surrounding practices are an \nexample of how a Korean performance of deference to the Ming engendered a space for symbolic \ncontestation, whose significances resonated well beyond the limits of its original, intended purpose. \nIn this chapter, I treat the Brilliant Flowers  as a novel technology of  Korean self -representation that \nfostered a space of social interaction between Ming emissaries and Chos\u014fn literati officials. It also \nshifted the burden of empire -making to literary sociability, which enabled the negotiation of imperial \nideology and its symbolism within the social space of diplomatic encounters. As a result, Chos\u014fn \nand its officials could co -opt and the co -construct Ming empire to suit their own interests and \npurposes.5 At stake in the practice of envoy poetry was how imperial authority was to be imagined \n                                                 \n4 Erving Goffman, The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life  (Garden City, N.Y.:", "doc_id": "27ab1989-3a2b-4e16-b2c5-0bbb5a03cf16", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "b615f6171ce8a1afe1a2942bf051bc5da4a9052167564dac5773830e5d0d0b93", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 828428, "end": 831140}, "relationships": {"1": "f47394fe-94c7-4ac0-a316-a92b37a55a86", "2": "643f497d-7905-44bb-9d65-6e29753d6a94", "3": "93dae955-93ea-489d-b8eb-491d223951a4"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "93dae955-93ea-489d-b8eb-491d223951a4": {"__data__": {"text": "to be imagined \n                                                 \n4 Erving Goffman, The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life  (Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday, 1959), pp. 10 \u201319, 22 \u201332. \n5 A study of the Brilliant Flowers , can sustain many angles of interpretation besides t his one, especially since it until now \nonly been treated in passing in previous scholarship.

The Brilliant Flowers  have recently been collated by Zhao Ji and \npublished in a modern print edition, which will surely encourage scholarly interest. Zhao Ji \u8d99\u5b63 , Zuben Huanghua ji \u8db3\n\u672c\u7687\u83ef\u96c6  (Nanjing: Fenghuang chubanshe, 2013).  \n \n 286  in relation to Korea \u2019s civilizing process, an issue which spoke directly to competing claims of \npolitical sovereignty and Korea \u2019s connection to the classical past.  \nThe Chos\u014fn court firs t published the Anthology of the Brilliant Flowers in 1457. The anthology \ncollected the poetry exchanges between Korean officials and the Ming envoys Chen Jian \u9673\u9451  \n(1415 \u20131471) and Gao Run \u9ad8\u6f64  (fl. 1457), who arrived that year to announce the restoration of t he \nYingzong emperor to the Ming throne. Documentary evidence for how the first edition of Brilliant \nFlowers came into being is scant, so reconstructing its origins is difficult. There are several plausible \nexplanations. The Chos\u014fn court could have printed the anthology as a favor for Chen and Gao. Or \nperhaps it was meant to showcase Korean literary accomplishment.6 Other scholars have suggested \nthat the anthology reaffirmed Chos\u014fn fealty to an embattled Ming dynastic house. In this view, the \nYingzong empero r, who had lived under house arrest after being returned to the Ming by his \nMongol captors, had only been restored to power after the sudden death of his brother, the Jingtai \nemperor. Sejo, whose own legitimacy was vulnerable as a usurper, published this a nthology to \ningratiate himself with the Ming.7 Each of these explanations has its merits, but the long -term \nsignificance for Chos\u014fn -Ming relations lies less in the conditions of the anthology \u2019s inception than \nin the life it had thereafter.  Whether a momentary accommodation to the whims of two Ming \nenvoys or a way to satisfy Ming desires for recognition at a time of dynastic vulnerability, it grew \nover time into something much more.  \nAfter its initial printing, the Brilliant Flowers became the center of a new diplomatic tradition. \nIts compilation, public ation, and distribution continued to the end of the Ming period.

Its novelty, both as a technology of representation and as a \nproduct of diplomati c interaction, made the anthology \u2019s emergence a watershed moment in Chos\u014fn -\nMing relations.  \nSome scholars have taken the rise of envoy poetry in  Chos\u014fn -Ming diplomacy to signal the \nadvent of \u201cideal\u201d tributary relations and thus mark the period of the Brilliant Flowers as emblematic of \nChos\u014fn -Ming relations in general. The turn to \u201cliterary diplomacy\u201d ( \u8a5e\u8ce6\u5916\u4ea4 ) indeed occurred in \nlock-step with political and cultural shifts at the Ming court.13 When the Ming court no longer sent \nspecial eunuch emissaries to Chos \u014fn to procure luxury goods and human tribute, as it had done in \nthe early fifteenth century, diplomacy with Korea left the hands of the inner palace and entered the \n                                                 \n11 Chief among these extant travelogues are the writings of the 1450 envoy Ni Qian, the 1460 envoy Zhang Ning, the \n1488 env oy Dong Yue, the 1537 envoy Gong Yongqing, the 1606 envoy Zhu Zhifan and the 1626 envoy Jiang \nYuekuang.

Ming diplomatic practice during the Hongwu -Jianwen reigns  (1368 \u20131404) was directed \npersonally by the emperor, who primarily relied on literati officials to carry out diplomacy. The Yongle to Tianshun \nperiods (1404 \u20131449), on the other hand, were dominated by Ming eunuchs, many of them Korean born. After the \nJingtai-Zhengtong reigns (1450 \u20131464), which coincides with the rise of envoy poetry and the debacle of Tumu, the \ncenter of gravity shifted again to Ming literati.

Not least of all, with diplomacy the purview of Ming literati, the \nvalues of literary and civil culture, represented by the Brilliant Flowers , became dominant. This shift \nmarginalized, both in practice and in histori cal representation, actors who were central to the \nexercise of diplomacy but who could not participate as social equals in literary exchange. Eunuchs, \nprofessional interpreters, and military officers were sidelined in favor of an imperial vision that \ncente red on Confucian men of letters.15 \nAgainst this broader pattern of shifts, one must resist viewing this pe riod of \u201cliterary \ndiplomacy\u201d as a distillation of \u201cideal\u201d tributary relations or Chos\u014fn -Ming relations. For one, t he \ngentlemanly exchange of letters  documented by the Brilliant Flowers was no more an essential feature \nof Chos\u014fn -Ming diplomacy than the exto rtive practices of Ming eunuchs (and literati) envoys were \nan aberration.16 A more critical problem is that essentializing Chos\u014fn -Ming relations as \u201cliterary \ndiplomacy\u201d risks naturalizing and obscuring the historical processes that led to these shifts in th e \nfirst place. If one uses the larger structural shifts to explain Chos\u014fn diplomatic practices, then the \nlatter appear only as reflections of broader changes, precluding the possibility that Chos\u014fn practices \nmight actually have effected structural change i n the first place. This chapter contends, instead, that \nliterati ascendancy in Ming politics alone cannot explain the domination of literary values and \npractices in Chos\u014fn -Ming diplomacy. The role of Chos\u014fn investment in the Brilliant Flowers must \nalso be appreciated.

Literati envoys only led missions that \nproclaimed matters of important to the imperial dynasty: accession of emperors and the investment of a Ming heir \napparent. Eunuchs still led e mbassies for investing Korean rulers or bequeathing gifts and titles to the Chos\u014fn royal clan. \nA literati emissary, however, came to accompany these missions as the vice -envoy and engaged in poetry exchange with \nChos\u014fn officials, excluding his eunuch super ior. \n16 See discussion in Chapter 3.  \n \n 290  encouraged the Ming to deal with Chos\u014fn in this channel.

This entire process is missed if the emergence of \nthis new mode of diplomacy  is taken for granted.  \nThe envoy poetry of the Brilliant Flowers , like other literary genres and rit ualized practices \ndiscussed thus far, did not reflect a political order, but constituted it. The anthology \u2019s many \npanegyrics to empire in fact fashioned ideals of empire to envision a proper place for Korea. \nThrough poetry writing, Ming and Chos\u014fn envoys c o-constructed an empire whose authority was \nnot invested in the force of arms or the movement of goods, but in a continual process of literary \nreenactment. The envoy poem brought the empire to life through its encomia, willing it into \nexistence through lit erary fiat. The literary turn of diplomacy elevated the generative power of the \nimperial project as a civilizing process , which rendered  Chos\u014fn into an object of its civilizing force. \nAs it became a consistent part of Chos\u014fn -Ming diplomacy, the anthology and its literary practices \nreified Chos\u014fn \u2019s identity as a loyal tributary, but also reinscribed imperial claims into a version of \nempire that the Chos\u014fn court and its officials had desired.  \nThe anthology \u2019s poems emphasized Korea \u2019s own independent transmission of dynastic \nlegitimacy, the literary prowess of its people, and its claim to a common civilizational past. At the \ncenter of this was a claim to local sovereignty articulated in Korea \u2019s own autonomous civilizing \nprocess. Not all of these claims, whether by Ming envoys or Chos\u014fn writers, were necessarily \ncompatible with one another. What made literary practice different from other context s of \nconstruction, then, was the coexistence of divergent views within one body of text. Co -construction \ndid not imply that either Ming or Chos\u014fn envoys necessarily shared a monolithic preconception of \nwhat the empire was. Poetic craft, then, provided the mechanisms where divergent and often \n \n 291  dissonant views could be harmonized and calibrated, even if only within the space of a couplet or \nquatrain.  \nFinding the Brilliant Flowers: Poetic Practice in Early Chos\u014fn Korea  \nEnvoy poetry was important to East Asian d iplomacy before the advent of the Brilliant \nFlowers.17 Imperial envoys and Korean officials had exchanged poems before, a practice dating to at \nleast the Jin period.18 Most notably, in 1396 the Chos\u014fn envoy Kw\u014fn K\u016dn wrote poems with the \nMing emperor Taizu, a n event widely celebrated by both the Chos\u014fn court and Ming envoys alike \nthrough the 16th century.19 \nDespite numerous antecedents the Chos\u014fn court, by compiling and publishing envoy poetry \nitself, fundamentally reinvented envoy poetry.

W hen Ming envoys published their own anthologies,20 they rarely \nincluded a substantial number of Korean poems, and chose instead to showcase their own writing.21 \nThe Brilliant Flowers , on the other hand, included both Ming and Chos\u014fn poetry in relatively equal \nproportion. It highlighted the literary accomplishments of Chos\u014fn courtiers alongside those of Ming \nenvoys, upholding them as cultural and social equals. By constructing these re lations of parity, the \nanthology hoped to foster mutual identification between Ming and Chos\u014fn diplomats, rather than \ncast them only as representatives of their respective rulers. Despite the ubiquitous references to the \nChos\u014fn ruler and the Ming emperor, the monarchs were conspicuously absent as actors, sidelined in \nfavor of the envoys and his hosts. In sum, the anthology repositioned the diplomatic center of \ngravity, shifting it from a relationship between a universal ruler and his monarch to one between \nliterary peers.  \nThe Brilliant Flowers \u2019 encouragement of mutual identification between men of letters \nimplicitly upheld literary values in the space of the political and the imperial. This strategic move is \nanalogous to other practices described in this dis sertation, but the Brilliant Flowers  did so in a \nparticularly self -referential way. Its title, \u201cHwanghwa\u201d (Ch: Huanghua \u7687\u83ef ) suggests an \ninextricable link between literary practice and imperial power. The polysemy of the  two characters, \nhwang (Ch: Huang, im perial/brilliant/august) and hwa (Ch: Hua, efflorescence/civilization/China), \nallows the title to be read as \u201caugust efflorescence (civilization),\u201d or \u201cimperial China.\u201d This latter, \nliteral reading of the term hwanghwa , however, was never explicitly employ ed in the Brilliant Flowers \n                                                 \n20 For instance, Ni Qian \u502a\u8b19 , Liaohai bian \u907c\u6d77\u7de8 , 1469 edition, Reprinted in Shi Chaoxian lu  (Beijing: Beijing \ntushuguan chuban she, 2003).  \n21 The extant anthologies of Chos\u014fn envoys included poetry, but usually only preserved their half of the exchanges with \nMing officials and scholars.  For an example see, Yi S\u016dngso, Samdan s\u014fnsaeng chip f.2, 6, 8 in HMC v.11.

When both Chos\u014fn and Ming envoy writers referred to the title of the anthology, they pointed \nto the term \u2019s locus classicus,  a piece in the Classic of Poetry. The poem, \u201cBrilliant are the flowers\u201d (Ch: \nHuanghuang zhehua \u7687\u7687\u8005\u83ef ), was so titled because of its affective image of flowers blooming \nbrilliantly across the landscape as a dutiful Zhou royal emissary traveled to feudal states to procure \nvirtuous men for his ruler.22 By couching it in the world of the classics, envoy poetry transformed \nthe Chos\u014fn and the Ming into inheritors of a hallowed tradition, fostering correspondences that \ntranscended distinctions of time and space. In this rendition the Ming envoy is the representative of \nthe Zhou king who travels to the feudal state of yore, now imagined t o be Chos\u014fn, where virtuous \nmen and beautiful customs await his discovery.  \nThe connection to the classical world of the Zhou depended on an appeal to a common \nliterary tradition through the writing of poetry itself. Cultural identification implied by writi ng the \nsame poetry helped construct a broader cultural imaginary. Through a shared knowledge of classical \ntexts, whether the received traditions of the Zhou Dynasty, the writings of Song Neo -Confucians, or \nthe poems of Tang masters, the literati of both Ch ina and Korea were by the fifteenth century \nwriting within a larger \u201cimagined community\u201d (only to borrow the language of Benedict Anderson) \nwith a common script.23 A shared cultural imaginary seemed to enable the expression of political \nallegiance.

The Korean envoy poem both assimilated the correlative \nauthority of imperial authority and declared loyalty to it. Moreover, the Chos\u014fn court \u2019s \nencourage ment of envoy poetry also suggests its allegiance to the imperial view of the world. \nModern scholars have therefore understood the Brilliant Flowers as an affirmation of a shared value \nsystem embodied in the literary tradition. Du Huiyue, for instance, tak es envoy poetry as clear \nevidence of both the Chos\u014fn court \u2019s unquestioned loyalty to the Ming and the admiration of \nChinese culture by the Ming elite.25 Such arguments seem compelling because classical poetics \nascribes poetry, especially the si-poem (Ch: shi \u8a69), the power to speak to the immediacy of human \nemotions, and thus read them as authentic representation of an author \u2019s sentiments (i.e. shi yan zhi \n\u8a69\u8a00\u5fd7 ). As such, they are also seen to be the genre most reflective of the author \u2019s interiority, and \n                                                 \n24 Stephen Owen, \u201cOmen in the World: Meaning in the Chinese Lyric,\u201d Traditional Chinese  Poetry and Poetics  (Madison: \nUniversity of Wisconsin, 1985), 27 \u201329. \n25 To date, Du offers the most extensive and authoritative body of work on the Brilliant Flowers. Her detailed analysis of \nits poems and its historical contextualization mainly serve a lit erary history, where the influence of Ming poetic trends on \nChos\u014fn poetry writing is the main analytical thrust. In her analysis of its historical significance, Du generally sees the \nBrilliant Flowers  as a reflection of \u201ctributary relations.\u201d Indeed, readi ng the poems of the Brilliant Flowers as examples of \nKorean sadae ideology or Korea \u2019s \u201csincere\u201d devotion to the Ming is the dominant hermeunetical strategy at work in most \nprevious literary studies on the Brilliant Flowers . According to Sin Tae -y\u014fng, the r elative obscurity of these texts in Korean \nlanguages studies is precisely tied to its connection with sadae ideology, because their existence jibes against nationalist \nsentiments and is perceived as shameful.

What \nbetter demonstration of Chos\u014fn \u2019s \u201cadmiration of China\u201d ( mohwa chu \u016di/muhwa zhuyi  \u6155\u83ef\u4e3b\u7fa9 ) and \ncommitment to \u201cServing the Great\u201d than the poems that expressed these sentiments?  \nThere are several problems with these views, all tied to the hermeneutics of reading si-poetry. \nProceeding from classical models to interpret poetry by assuming its lyrical authenticity risks \nneglecting the social and political contexts of their composition. Moreover, in the Chos\u014fn context, it \nignores a history of centuries of appropriation and reinvention. Korean rulers had long appropriated \nthe techn ologies and ideologies of empire and intertwined their own legitimacy with the symbolic \nauthority of emperors. For Chos\u014fn envoy writers, the \u201ccorrelative cosmology\u201d tied the poem not \nonly to imperial authority, but the Chos\u014fn kingship as well. Seeing poeti c practice only as a \nreflection of politics also implies a recursive and reductive determinism. Certainly, literary practice \ncan and does reflect diplomatic norms, for political hierarchies, ideological underpinnings, and \ninstitutional arrangements all bec ome visible in the rhetoric and practice of the envoy poem. But, if \npoetry is understood in terms of its ability to reflect the \u201creal\u201d (constituted by things such as power, \nprestige, hierarchy, or structure, which often are in fact scholarly abstractions),  it suggests one -\ndimensional, unidirectional relationship between politics and literary practice, with the former \ndetermining the latter. It discounts the possibility that the literary production could also shape the \npolitical. As a form of representation,  literary exchange was part of a political theater, pe rformed \nwith instrumental aims.  \nClassical formulations notwithstanding, later writers of poetry saw the performance and \nartifice inherent in literary craft as undercutting the sentimental spontaneity an d authenticity of the \n                                                 \n26 Stephen Owen, Readings in Chinese Literary Thought  (Cambridge, Mass.: Council on East Asian Studies, Har vard \nUniversity: Distributed by Harvard University Press, 1992), 37\u201344. \n \n 296  poem , and thus its moral value as a whole.27 Early Chos\u014fn courtier -poets shared these anxieties \nover craft and its threat to poetry \u2019s moral value.

The reception of the late Tang poet Wen Tingyun \u6eab\u5ead\n\u7b60 (812\u2013870), known for his crafted, is a case in point. Paul F. Rouze r, Writing Another \u2019s Dream: The Poetry of Wen Tingyun  \n(Stanford University Press, 1993), 1 \u201326. \n28 Peter H.

A cursory examination of early Chos\u014fn collections of the writings of individual authors ( munjip \u6587\u96c6 ) \nshow both the preponderance and preeminence of  verse genres, like the si, over prose writing. In many anthologies, the \nsi-poem alone occupies half of the fascicles. Not only is si the most frequently represented kind of writing, it invariably is \nincluded in the front of such anthologies, suggesting also their relative significa nce. On the other hand, poetry in classical \nChinese has largely been neglected by Anglophone scholarship on premodern Korea. This neglect reflects the \npredilections of modern scholars and not of its level of relevance to early Chos\u014fn elite society. The emb eddedness and \nubiquity of poetry writing in Chos\u014fn elite life may explain the ubiquity apologies for its practice by serious Confucian \nmoralists. Neo -Confucian scholars like Kim Chongjik ( \u91d1\u5b97\u76f4  1431 \u20131492) tried to reconcile literary practice with the \nbroader  program of Confucian learning, though he still dismissed literature as a \u201cminor skill\u201d ( \u5c0f\u6280 ) of \u201clittle", "doc_id": "06ea4ae1-7e8f-4d7b-b51f-b7b0c2f20bfd", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "0cfb4ce642582aad66f6d70646f4e4062f6cc9e2164fefd13bf4b36d2fbfaca8", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 862910, "end": 865838}, "relationships": {"1": "f47394fe-94c7-4ac0-a316-a92b37a55a86", "2": "6af96cd4-f64e-4091-861d-7bdb18d45d20", "3": "de01125b-b9ac-439d-8faa-919ce52c41f2"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "de01125b-b9ac-439d-8faa-919ce52c41f2": {"__data__": {"text": "Neo -Confucian scholars like Kim Chongjik ( \u91d1\u5b97\u76f4  1431 \u20131492) tried to reconcile literary practice with the \nbroader  program of Confucian learning, though he still dismissed literature as a \u201cminor skill\u201d ( \u5c0f\u6280 ) of \u201clittle \nimportance\u201d ( \u672b\u7aef ).

Poetry writing in diplomacy, however, was not simply a matter of entertaining Ming envoys, \nfor Chos\u014fn court poets  invested their writing with moral and political claims that impacted the \nlegitimacy and authority of the Chos\u014fn state on the one hand, and the ideological construction of \nthe Ming and its empire on the other.  \nThe envoy poet was ever aware of the public n ature of his writings, visible not only to his \ncounterparts on the outset, but with their systematic publication by the Chos\u014fn court, privy to \nposterity. This awareness did not preclude assertions of authentic sentiment, but this emphasis \npoints to the pro blems of trust and sincerity inherent to diplomacy.32 The purported lyrical \nauthenticity of the poem then went hand in hand with the need to establish trust with one \u2019s audience \nby assuring them of one \u2019s sincerity. Like in other diplomatic genres, such as th e p\u2019yomun memorial \ndiscussed in Chapter 1, sincerity was a construct of the genre. These practices reflected ideology and \nstructure, but only because its ideology and structure emerged from them.  \nThe intertwined political use and social practice of poetry should reveal where the classical \nformulation of lyrical authenticity is inadequate.  Envoy poets wrote for social moments. The \nanthology \u2019s paratexts: prefaces, titles, and postscripts, indicate with specificity their social function.33 \nChos\u014fn and Ming envoy s often wrote poems to each via a popular form of linked composition, \n                                                 \n31 S\u014fngjong sillok  122:9a [1480/10/26#3].  \n32 Ming envoys, for example, often called into q uestion the sincerity of the Chos\u014fn court \u2019s allegiance to the Ming, \nespecially in times of crisis.

They addressed these poems to Chos\u014fn interpreters, medical officials and \nother members of the Korean reception committee, thanking them for their company.  \n \n 298  called \u201crhyme -matching\u201d (ch\u2019aun/ciyun \u6b21\u97fb ).34 Rhyme -matching required responses to a \npredecessor \u2019s poetry to use the same rhyme words, a practice conducive to the recycling of tropes \nand i mages. Since Ming envoys often responded to predecessors separated by decades, if not  \ncenturies, this practice granted  diplomatic relati ons between the two states a semblance of \ntimeless ness. The Chos\u014fn court reinforced this image by carving these poems on  plaques and steles \nthat adorned the sites Ming envoys visited. Both these envoys and their Chos\u014fn hosts consulted \nprior editions of the Brilliant Flowers as models for their own compositions. As it came to be used \nand reused through the 17th century, the Brilliant Flowers emerged as a repertoire of knowledge for \nboth Chos\u014fn and Ming envoys.35 All in all, the poems of this anthology, ranging from brief \nquatrains to extended meditations sustained over sixty or seventy couplets, were not self -contained \npieces of private introspection, but products of literary sociability.36 \nLiterary exchange, as a medium of sociability, often enshrined a sense of personal friendship \nbetween Ming literati envoys and their Chos\u014fn counterparts. In their exchanges, they often \nexpres sed sentiments they hoped would transcend both political geography and human time.37 The \nsocial embeddeness of envoy poetry is also corroborated by the intertextual relations an individual \n                                                 \n34 Scholars have generally read \u201crhyme -matching \u201d as kind of ritualized exchange to satisfy political needs.

The Chos\u014fn court thus tried to foster this identification, \nselecting only the best literary talents to be members of the envoy reception committee.41 Hoping to \nfurther showcase Korean talent, it published the Brilliant Flowers  to secure imperial attention for \nChos\u014fn writers, and by extension, Korea \u2019s cultural accomplishments. In this manner, sociability and \nliterary talent went hand in hand. Even as the Brilliant Flowers clearly coded the hierarchical \ndistinction between the Ming emperor and the Chos\u014fn ruler,42 it posited an alternative relationship \nof parity, in which the Chos\u014fn and the Ming were peers in cultural attainment.  \nThe Chos\u014fn court and its scho lars made considerable efforts to claim this parity, but \nstruggled against Ming condescension.43 The mid -Chos\u014fn miscellany writer, Yu Mong \u2019in \u67f3\u5922\u5bc5  \n(1559 \u20131623), who traveled several times to the Ming as an", "doc_id": "0461d01c-f414-4a6c-ba3d-290e4ea691b5", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "44a9155320c747874db88d6dd7b0c45a710523b3e1388fbdf0d2d421176869aa", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 873740, "end": 876266}, "relationships": {"1": "f47394fe-94c7-4ac0-a316-a92b37a55a86", "2": "293e5ac2-9f21-46df-9a79-71591e185d95", "3": "64a8e9b1-7cbd-4208-beed-91ec8bce993c"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "64a8e9b1-7cbd-4208-beed-91ec8bce993c": {"__data__": {"text": "court and its scho lars made considerable efforts to claim this parity, but \nstruggled against Ming condescension.43 The mid -Chos\u014fn miscellany writer, Yu Mong \u2019in \u67f3\u5922\u5bc5  \n(1559 \u20131623), who traveled several times to the Ming as an envoy, once complained that \u201cover these \n                                                 \n40 This i dentification should not be taken for granted.

Without discriminating between the \u201cbeautiful \nand the ugly,\u201d they included everything.48 Yu and Qian blamed the anthology \u2019s diluted quality o n \ndifferent parties, but their diagnosis was essentially identical. Accommodation of sociability and \npolitical exigency, whether by the Chos\u014fn compilers or the Ming poets, was ultimately at fault.  \nBoth Qian and Yu \u2019s critiques might have suggested that col lection ultimately failed to secure \nKorean literary reputation, but these later judgments must be accepted only cautiously. Dismissals of \nliterary quality only underscored the political, social, and ideological function of this anthology. A \nreader in searc h of timeless poetry may be disappointed by the Brilliant Flowers \u2019 heavy -handed \nideology and ornate imagery, interspersed with the doggerel of sociability. Those in search of its \npolitical symbolism, however, will find much to appreciate.49 Qian Qianyi may have dismissed the \n                                                 \n47 Such a statement was undoubtedly what Yu had in mind when he spoke of the condescension of Ming literati. \nIndeed, Qian \u2019s assessment of the  Brilliant Flowers did later earn the ire of later Korean readers.

Sin Taey\u014fng \u2019s \nmonograph in Korean and Du Huiyue \u2019s in Chinese, both studies of literary history, a re the only full -length studies that \nsubstantively engage with this text. This neglect by historians is remarkable given the sheer volume of historical \nscholarship devoted to Sino -Korean relations as a whole. It is also understandable, given the dominance of diplomatic \nand political history in this field. The Brilliant Flowers offers little in the way of diplomatic or political history. Most poems \nwere written within the conventions of imperial encomium, and social poetry, with its penchant for social plati tudes and \ngeneric tropes rarely offer information that could not be otherwise discovered in other sources, such as Ming envoy \ntravel writing or the detailed accounts of Ming embassies in the Chos\u014fn Veritable Records .

Their \nsuperimposition of the literary, social, and political in one space, a result of poetry written to satisfy \nthe needs o f a moment, made them vulnerable to later critical appraisals, but it is precisely the \nfeature that makes these anthologies a useful window into the culture of diplomacy of this period.51 \nThe superimposition generates several points of tension, namely the f unction of the literary to \noverwrite political and social friction and the multivocality of a literary sociability at the service of \npolitical ideology. The task of literary encomium precluded overt discussion of contentious areas in \nChos\u014fn -Ming relations.  A veneer of high imperial rhetoric celebrated the beautiful and the virtuous, \nglazing over possible sources of animosity and conflict, to construct a harmonious social space \nparalleling  the tranquil relations between the two courts.  \n                                                 \n50 The Chos\u014fn court observed the Ming calendar and showed deference to the Ming emperor, raising words such as \n\u201cimperial,\u201d \u201cemp eror,\u201d and \u201cheaven\u201d to indicate the Ming \u2019s superiority.

The Ming could \nalways count on its own off icials to sing its praises, but  here, the celebration of empire ceased to be \na solipsist \u2019s exercise in self -adulation. Chos\u014fn officials, by literally resonating with Ming \nambassadors, confirmed the authenticity and legitimacy of Ming imperial claims. As disparate parties \ncame together and rhymed in their celebration of the Ming, they co -produc ed the empire in \ndiscourse. Yet, this multivocality cut both ways. Even as these envoys wrote to harmonize in \nideology, rhetoric, and literary style, fractures and divisions still come to the fore as the diverse \nparticipants of the Brilliant Flowers advanc ed competing narratives of what empire was and should be.   \nImperial Encomium and the Academic Style  \nThe poetry of political encomium in Ming literary history is associated with the so -called \n\u201cSecretariat Style\u201d (Ch: taige ti \u53f0\u95a3\u9ad4 ), so-called because it evolved from the poetry of the Three \nYang \u2019s \u4e09\u694a , Yang Shiqi \u694a\u58eb\u5947  (1364 \u20131444), Yang Rong \u694a\u69ae  (1371 \u20131440), and Yang Fu \u694a\n\u6ea5 (1372 \u20131446), three figures who made their literary careers in the Ming Grand Secretariat.52 \nThough these men only  held low -ranking posts as academicians53 of the Hanlin Academy54, they \noccupied a keystone position as liaisons between the emperor and the civil bureaucracy.55 By virtue \nof both the prestige and concrete political power concentrated in such figures, these a cademicians \nexerted enormous influence on both literary trends and political decision making.

Attributing its dominance to the Ming \u2019s tangible prosperity during the \nYongle and Xuande reigns, debacles such as the Battle of Tumu turned the \u201cSecretariat Style\u201d into \nan artifact of courtly conceit.57 It was ironically the wa ne of Ming power that brought this academic \npoetry to Chos\u014fn. In fact, the first envoy to engage in extensive poetic exchange with Chos\u014fn \nofficials, Ni Qian \u502a\u8b19  (1415 \u20131479), who arrived in Chos\u014fn to proclaim the accession of the \nJingtai emperor, has been de scribed as a representative Secretariat poet.58 Ni Qian was not alone \namong the mid -Ming envoy -poets associated with this court -centered literary circle. The 1457 envoy \nChen Jian and the 1460 envoy Zhang Ning too were also well -known academic poets of this \nperiod.59 \n                                                 \n56 Du Huiyue, Mingdai wenchen chu shi Chaoxian, 183\u2013202; Later critics of Ming poetry, such a s Yoshikawa K\u014djir\u014d \ndescribed the poetry of the Yang \u2019s as an \u201cextremely tedious verse\u201d and the period it dominated as a time of \u201ccultural \nhiatus.\u201d Yoshikawa Ko \u0304jiro\u0304, Five Hundred Years of Chinese Poetry, 1150 -1650\u202f: The Chin, Yuan, and Ming Dynasties  (Prin ceton, \nNew Jersey \u202f: Princeton University Press, 1989), 122 \u2013123. More recently, however, the \u201cSecretariat Style\u201d has been \nreevaluated. Scholars such as Li Shenghua no longer sees these encomiums to be mere paeans of power written by \npolitical toadies ( \u653f\u6cbb\u7684\u5e6b\u9592 ), but the moral and political visions of upright statesmen. Such a view seeks to rescue the \npoem by salvaging the moral character of its writers, but even for Li, its moral message could not prevent it from \nbecoming a \u201cmediocre mode\u201d ( \u4e0d\u514d\u5eb8\u97f3 ).

By the end 15th century, the \nGrand Secretary Li Dongyang ( \u674e\u6771\u967d  1447 \u20131516), had spearheaded a transformation of academic poetry, but retained \nelements of the \u201cSecretariat Style\u201d in his so -called Chaling Sch ool poetry ( \u8336\u9675\u6d3e ). Li Dongyang too had been a close, \njunior associate of the Ming envoys Ni Qian and Dong Yue, having written posthumous commemorations of their life \nand work.

Since Ming literati usually only led \nembassies to announce the accession of a new emperor or th e investiture of a Ming heir apparent, \non many occasions the \u201cSagely Ruler\u201d on the throne was but newly crowned, untested in rule. \nChos\u014fn \u2019s affirmation of loyalty to the Ming was doubly significant in such times, as it insisted a \nstereotyped image of the i mperial person that was consistently sagely, benevolent, and perfect in \nthese literary encomiums. Just as, in the words of Gari Ledyard, \u201ceach new diplomatic pouch to \nKorea\u201d brought a message that insisted on the perfectibility of imperial virtue, in spite  of the \n\u201ctyranny and delinquency\u201d of the Ming emperor, the envoy poems of the Brilliant Flowers proscribed \nan imperial personality equally disembodied from tangible reality.60 \nThe primary audience for the Brilliant Flowers were not Ming emperors, but the Mi ng \nSecretaries and Hanlin Academicians charged with actualizing a vision of civil rule and who often \nhad to negotiate and contend with the highly personal and arbitrary style of Ming sovereigns. By \ndescribing emperors in this manner together, Chos\u014fn and Mi ng literati constructed a shared ideal of \nempire that could also be a vehicle for censure.61 Disembodied ideals of empire were constructed \nagainst the imperfect reality of imperial virtue that Ming officials and Chos\u014fn courtiers alike knew \ntoo well.62 Detach ment did not make the rhetoric and imagery of encomium meaningless; instead, it \nshould be read as an elucidation of an institutionalized ideal, an illocutionary act that reinforced not \n                                                 \n60 Gari Ledyard, \u201cConfucianism and War: The Korean Security Crisis of 1598,\u201d 83.  \n61", "doc_id": "2f400f40-0e7f-429c-ad02-1f464efa74f0", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "b8f4e31a9b3bd334aed69293c0f41c8726e01ee62cea7ee236099b8acce8a38a", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 893460, "end": 896314}, "relationships": {"1": "f47394fe-94c7-4ac0-a316-a92b37a55a86", "2": "28ac3b4f-2b60-42de-817b-6e1f03ad5508", "3": "37e1427f-de26-46da-afdd-d051ba60eba4"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "37e1427f-de26-46da-afdd-d051ba60eba4": {"__data__": {"text": "                                              \n60 Gari Ledyard, \u201cConfucianism and War: The Korean Security Crisis of 1598,\u201d 83.  \n61 Philip de Heer, The Care -Taker Emperor: Aspects of the Imperial  Institution in Fifteenth -Century China as Reflected in the Political \nHistory of the Reign of Chu Ch \u2019i-Yu\u0308 (Leiden: Brill, 1986), 5; John W.

These poems \nfabricated an empire in the abstract, not a human emperor.63 \nThe features of the \u201cSecretariat Style\u201d also define the poetry of the Brilliant Flowers. As \nimperial academicians, secretariat poems wrote on imperial command. Court lif e: banquets, royal \noutings, ascent poems, painting inscriptions, compositions on history, and seeing off fellow officials \nwere among its major topoi.64 The 1460 envoy Zhang Ning \u2019s \u201cAscending the tower at the Hall of \nGreat Peace in sixty rhymes\u201d is a quintes sential example of the kinds of scenic writing common to \nboth the \u201cSecretariat Style\u201d and the Brilliant Flowers . Aptly named, for it describes a vision of grand \npeace that appear ed during the ascension of a  tower by the same name. Located in the residence for \nMing envoys in the Chos\u014fn capital, the Hall of Great Peace ( T\u2019aep\u2019y\u014fnggwan \u592a\u5e73\u9928 ) was the site for \nbanquets held in an envoy \u2019s honor. Zhang \u2019s postface to his poem written on this occasion tied \nliterary enterprise with the political aspirations of empire.  Conventions of ascending high, scenic \ndescription, and historical rumination fuse together in this piece:  \nIn the spring of the fourth year of the Tianshun reign, I came as an envoy to Chos\u014fn on imperial \norders. I ascended high and looked off into the dist ance, thinking of the imperial capital and looked \naround me at the kingdom [of Korea].

Because the \nMing had \u201cinherited the statutes of the Zhou,\u201d ( \u81ba\u5468\u5178\u5247 ) its \u201cterritory covered all that was once \nthe Han \u2019s domain\u201d ( \u8f3f\u5716\u76e1\u5c6c\u6f22\u63d0\u5c01 ).67  \nFavorable comparisons to past dynasties and ancient Sage Kings in the lines of the Brilliant \nFlowers were not in themselves interesting because they were common in other imperial  paeans, but \nthey were deployed in conjunction with favored tropes particular to the Brilliant Flowers. Imperial \nuniversalism was one of them. Chos\u014fn writers who responded to Ming envoys in verse made use of \nsimilar devices. The restoration of Ming Yingzon g to power in 1457 elicited the lines: \u201c[the emperor] \nagain pacifies the Jade Domain [i.e. the empire]; proclaiming [his rule] within and without, he begins \nanew with all -under -heaven, seeing it all with one heart.\u201d Though it opens with a n oblique referenc e \nto Yingzong \u2019s restoration, the tract immediately turns away from the imperial person towards the \nquality of the Ming \u2019s impartial gaze.68 Chos\u014fn diplomats often appealed to this impartiality, when \nthey made demands upon Ming emperors and officials alike.

The splendors of nature generate profusely from his brush, quickening with \nthe coming of spring.73 \nThe generative power of spring functioned as a metaphor for the power of literary \nproduction. In turn, writing was a vehicle of the empire \u2019s civilizing influence. The literary \nincorporation of Chos\u014fn \u2019s landscape into an imperial gaze was inseparable from political \nimplications. Like in the poem of the 1537 envoy Gong Yongqing \u9f94\u7528\u537f  (1500 \u20131563), \u201cCrossing \nthe Yalu\u201d ( \u6e21\u9d28\u7da0 ) where the imperial messenger \u2019s passage across the Yalu River awakened the \nflowers on the river \u2019s banks, the envoy, an agent of empire, literally brought civilization to distant \nlands. For Gong, all this was self -evident confirmation that \u201cliterary influenc e belonged to one rule.74 \nIn the logic of this literary device, celebrations of Korea \u2019s own literary accomplishments could then \nalways further indicate the Ming \u2019s achievements. The 1476 envoy Qi Shun \u2019s \u201cRhapsody on Phoenix \nHill\u201d (\u9cf3\u5c71\u8ce6 ) illustrates this motif.

All of these notions have classical referents and are loaded with \nsignificance, both to the Neo -Confucian philosophical tradition and literary culture in general, albeit each to varying \ndegrees. Shengjiao (Kr. s\u014fnggyo ) might emphasize the moral quality o f this influence, whereas wen (Kr: mun) \u6587 and \np\u2019ung/feng \u98a8 might suggest its literary dimension, though its moral potential and its connection with civilization (and by \nextension, its morality) are implied as well. These words appear in various combination s-- hwa/hua \u5316 points to a \ntransformative power, although p\u2019ung/feng \u98a8 too has such implications. And finally there is  hwangp \u2019ung/huangfeng \u7687\u98a8  \nand hwanghwa/huanghua \u7687\u5316 , capturing the role of the Emperor and the empire in this transformative process. While \nthese terms are not identical, they are interconnected in their historical usage. The term s\u014fnggyo/shengjiao  \u8072\u6559  expands \ninto s\u014fngwi kyohwa/shengwei jiaohua \u8072\u5a01\u6559\u5316 . Kyohwa/jiaohua \u6559\u5316  as a term, along with p\u2019ung/feng \u98a8 appears in the \n\u201cGreat Preface\u201d to the Book of Songs as \u98a8 \u98a8\u4e5f  \u6559\u4e5f  \u98a8\u4ee5\u52d5\u4e4b  \u6559\u4ee5\u5316\u4e4b .

The Song Neo -Confucian Zhu Xi, whose ideas were foundational to both early Ming and \nChos\u014fn thought, insisted that there were distant reaches, the so -called huangfu (Kr: hwangpok \u8352\u670d ), \nwhere civilizing influence could not reach.91 In other words there were two competing theoretical \nvisions at work, one where influence could extend infinitely, and another in which geography placed \na natural boundary to it s extension. The question that remains was where Korea fit into this scheme. \nWas it a place where imperial influence could reach, or a place beyond its pale?  \nAs discussed in chapter 2, the first Ming emperor Hongwu chose the latter interpretation \nwhen he r ejected the Chos\u014fn founder \u2019s request for investiture.92 He had told the Chos\u014fn court to \n\u201cdo [the activity of] shengjiao on one \u2019s own terms\u201d ( \u8072\u6559\u81ea\u7531 ).

An exclusive focus on Chos\u014fn agency may occlude the Ming \u2019s role as a \ntransmitter of knowledge and a model for Korean institutions, but understanding this process solely \nin terms of Ming influence leads to more critical problems. For one, it discounts prior Korean \ninterest in  Neo-Confucianism and the classical tradition in general well before the Ming \u2019s founding. \nAfter all, Ming gifts of books would have been meaningless without a ready audience to receive, \ninterpret, and apply the knowledge they contained. Korean rulers and their subjects  did not need \nMing exhortation to \u201cread books;\u201d they were doing it already. Korea \u2019s civilizing process was not a \nspontaneous response to imperial virtue.

This  tension directly impinges on how the Brilliant Flowers and envoy poetry should be \ninterpreted. Scholar Du Huiyue points to the reaction of Ming literati to Korean envoy poetry. For \nthem, such as the Ming scholar Wu Jie \u5433\u7bc0  (1416 \u2013?), who wrote a preface to the Ming envoy Ni \nQian \u2019s poetry anthology, Korean poetry exchanges were not only \u201ctestimonies to Korea \u2019s \n                                                 \n106 Sejong sillok  6:10a [1419/12/07#3]; For the significance of the Great Compendia , see Bol, Neo-Confucianism in History , \n147\u2013149. \n \n 323  civilization,\u201d but also a demonstration of \u201cthe success of the Ming dynasty \u2019s propagation of civil and \nConfucian cu lture to faraway lands.\u201d107 To show that Korean writers expressed similar sentiments, \nDu uses as an example S\u014f K\u014fj\u014fng \u2019s preface to the personal collection of poems exchanged with  \nMing envoys compiled by the Chos\u014fn official Pak W\u014fnhy\u014fng \u6734\u5143\u4ea8  (1411 \u20131469).

What \nfollows instead is a delineation of political hierarchy  descending  from emperor to king to courtier  \nthat was  couched in a series of linked reciprocities. The Chos\u014fn king and the Ming emperor \ncomplement one another in this visio n of political order. And, through the mediation of the talented \ncourtier who \u201cbrought respect to our king\u201d and \u201cglory to the Son of Heaven \u2019s court,\u201d the Ming \u2019s \nbenevolent impartiality and the Chos\u014fn king \u2019s dutiful service to t he emperor fashion one anothe r. \nS\u014f\u2019s formulation illustrates a clear alternative to how Ming observers interpreted literary \nexchange in diplomacy. Here, each element played a vital role in constructing the political order of \nempire. The Chos\u014fn king received his own mandate, but in thi s account, the courtier took center \nstage. It was the mediating role of the Korean literati courtier \u2014people like S\u014f K\u014fj\u014fng himself and \nhis friend Pak W\u014fnhy\u014fng \u2014who made empire possible.  \nS\u014f argued that Chos\u014fn and the Ming derived their civilization from a co mmon wellspring of \nantiquity. The Ming, as guardians of that tradition, had become the fountainhead of its transmission \nin the here and now, but it could not prevent the Chos\u014fn from also claiming a direct, independent \navenue of transmission to that classic al past.111 Nonetheless, in the context of envoy poetry and \nother diplomatic writing, that Chos\u014fn claim had to be attenuated with an acknowledgment of Ming \nclaims as well.

This will be discussed furt her in Chapter 6.  \n \n 326  (\u6d77\u5167\u8af8\u4faf ) becomes significant, not so much as a way to express Ming suzerainty, but rather as an \nevocation of a pre -imperial past, the age of Sage rulers and classical texts.112 \nThese parallel narratives of \u201ccivilization,\u201d in terms of Ming influence, of the Chos \u014fn court \u2019s \nactivist efforts, and of Korea \u2019s independent cultural transmission from the past, provided the \ninterpretive lens to understand  social phenomena. The case of the filial daughter of Kwaksan is \nillustrative. Ming envoys traveling to Seoul always pa ssed through the town of Kwaksan \u90ed\u5c71  in \nPy\u014fng \u2019an province. There, by the roadside, they saw a stele and memorial gate ( ch\u014fngny\u014f \u65cc\u95ad ) \nerected on the orders of the Chos\u014fn court in 1422 to honor the memory of a filial daughter named \nKim Saw\u014fl \u91d1\u56db\u6708 . Abandoned by her father as a child, Kim lived alone with a mother who \nsuffered from seizures. When she learned that bone and flesh from a living person could heal her \nmother \u2019s afflictions, she cut off her finger and fed it to her mother. Her filial act apparently worke d; \nher mother recovered.113 In 1450, the envoy Ni Qian first took notice of the  \nmonuments an d dedicated a poem to her. Later Ming envoys and their Chos\u014fn companions  \n                                                 \n112 The term \u201cfeudal lord of the interior\u201d ( \u6d77\u5167\u8af8\u4faf ) literally referred to titled nobles at the Ming court. Various \nprincely fiefs were granted to Ming royal family members and meritorious military officials, but their grants did not \noperate a s autonomous polities. They were more or less prebendal grants that allotted princes a set income, but did not \noffer political control. This arrangement contrasts with the political function of classical Zhou fiefdoms, which were \nupheld often held by early  Confucians and later classicists as a model political order.

To Ni Qian, she testified to the \u201cfar \nextent\u201d of the \u201ccivilizing transformation\u201d of successive Ming emperors .115 Ming imperial grace, \nwhich \u201cdid not distinguish between the civilized and the barbarian\u201d116 made Saw\u014fl \u2019s deeds possible. \nNi\u2019s respondent, the Chos\u014fn official Sin Sukchu \u7533\u53d4\u821f  (1417 \u20131475) saw the matter differently:  \n....Our King affirms filial principles;  \nWhere there is good he will bring it to light.  \nPraising the beautiful to admonish future men,  \nHe carves [these deeds] in stone to set them apart.  \nTo set examples, so that all will have their place,  \nAre memorial doorways, gates and posts.  \nAnd so, this filial daughter \u2014 \nHer fragrant name will always be exalted.  \n \nSin Sukchu framed these lines with a celebration of Ming empire, but the agency of elevating Korean \ncustoms clearly belonged to the Chos\u014fn.

Chos\u014fn writers reconciled these tensions by elevating them to a  different \nregister, tying a common project of literary production to classical models of antiquity. Rather than \nemphasize Chos\u014fn \u2019s role at the expense of an imperial view, they circumvented the issue by \nincorporating Chos\u014fn into the imperial vision in spe cific ways. The Chos\u014fn poet -official Yi Haeng \n\u674e\u8347  (1478 \u20131534) wrote:  \n...Who knew that this one girl,  \nWould alone be collected among the envoy \u2019s poems?  \nI heard that Confucius had once upon said  \n\u201cVirtue will certainly have its neighbors\u201d  \nThough [this] small c ountry is a foreign land,  \nIts people are also of the Imperial House.  \nIts people all devote themselves,  \nTo better understand the [Sage] King \u2019s [civilizing] transformations.121 \n \nDeclaring that Koreans were also \u201cpeople.... of the imperial house\u201d was not founde d on a desire to \nbecome a Ming subject de jure , but an appeal to the universal applicability of classic al civilization. The \nvirtuous actions of Kim Saw\u014fl did become a demonstration of Chos\u014fn \u2019s commitment to the Ming \nimperium, but did not offer testimony to the Ming \u2019s civilizing project per se. The civilizing role of the \nSage King, wanghwa (\u738b\u5316 ), sits ambiguo usly in the poem, equatable to the moral teachings of \nantiquity, the civilizing role of the reigning emperor, and the rule of the Chos\u014fn king. The Ming \u2019s \ncivilizing power and Chos\u014fn \u2019s project of Confucianization blended together in a narrative of filiality  \nthat synthesized the two visions, obviating the need to claim primacy for one over the other.  \nThe synthesis  led to an emphasis on the literary agency of the envoy. Indeed, the envoy and \nhis writings sometimes stole the spotlight that was ostensibly shone on the filial daughter.

The writers negotiated the implicit tension between these views by relying on a series of \nalternating deferral s. By appropriating the filial daughter as a symbol for both the Ming and the \nChos\u014fn \u2019s civilizing project, the poems never resolved the question of primacy.

Such gestures not only for egrounded their own literary activities \nin diplomatic space, but also couched the significance of envoy literary exchange in the language of \nantiquity and the classical past. The envoy Xue Tingchong \u859b\u5ef7\u5bf5  (fl. 1532 \u20131539) described his \npaean to the filial dau ghter as a \u201csong of a country \u2019s customs (Ch: guofeng ) collected from a boudoir \ngate\u201d (\u570b\u98a8\u6b4c\u8b20\u91c7\u95a8\u9580 ). The term guofeng, evoked the \u201cAirs of the States\u201d section in the Classic  of \nSongs, where the customs of feudal states were collected to reflect their moral cond ition. Posing as a \nZhou emissary who \u201csearched all around,\u201d Xue evoked a classical model by comparing his own \nmusings to works collected by the \u201cmusic officials\u201d of yore. Although the classical model suggested \nthe songs were supposed to be local lyrics, no t the writings of the envoy, the function of writing was \nthe same. He was to document the beautiful customs he observed so as to encourage their \ncontinued practice .124  \nThe evocation of the Books  of Songs lends broader significance to envoy poetry, assigning  a \npurpose to diplomatic exchange that situated it in a politics of moral transformation while making \nthe imperial emissary the central agent in this affair.

Like the Airs, reputed to have been collected by Confucius from the vassals of the Zhou, \ntheir poetry exchanges were to refl ect the social mores of Chos\u014fn.  \n \n 333  If you are to investigate all of the Eastern Kingdom,  \nYou will find that is not only Kwaksan that has such sites!125 \n \nThis appeal to the envoy \u2019s professed duties of representation reminded the envoy that Korea, t he \n\u201cEast,\u201d had always been a place suffused with civilization. Kim Saw\u014fl was not a recent anomaly. \nOnly by accurately representing these facts could the envoy do justice to the Eastern Kingdom. So \u2019s \narticulation intertwined this appeal with his own evocati on of the Books of Songs \u2014by mentioning the \n\u201cCry of the Fishawks\u201d ( guanjiu  \u95dc\u96ce ), the first poem of the Airs of the States (Ch: guofeng  \u570b\u98a8 ), but \nthe role of this allusion served an altogether different purpose.126 While the hierarchical implications \nof this ana logy\u2014the Ming as the Zhou, and the Chos\u014fn as a vassal state \u2014were clear, it also revived \nthe image of the classical, ideal past in the current world, actualized through Korea \u2019s own efforts. So \nSeyang credited the Ming with tending the light of civilization,  but it was a civilization that began \nwith the literature of the Book of Songs . In this rendition, the Ming \u2019s role was severely curtailed. It was \nneither the agent of the civilizing process in Korea nor the fountainhead of civilization. The former \nhonor we nt to the Chos\u014fn court and the latter belonged to the Sages of antiquity.  \nTurning to literature as the origin of civilization converted the political relationship between \nthe Chos\u014fn and the Ming into one that served a purpose larger than the relationship i tself. Their \nactivities were to be part and parcel of a grand reenactment of the classical past.

This combination of tropes, the \nliterary r esolution to the embedded tension between parallel narratives of the civilizing process and \nthe evocation of classical models, was not unique to the poems of the filial daughter. It also echoed \nother attempts in the Brilliant Flowers to tie Chos\u014fn to classical antiquity.  S\u014f K\u014fj\u014fng \u2019s preface to the \n1476 Brilliant Flowers offers a case in point:128  \nWhen the Kingly Way flourishes,the Odes and Hymns  are composed, and so the traces of perfect rule \ncan thus be investigated. In the past, durin g the height of the Zhou, the poems of Daming, Huangyi, \nYupu, Zaolu129 were enough to elucidate prosperity and beauty and renewed the [literary] creations of \nan era. And so, [the Zhou] employed officials to collect poems, and even the minor [works] of the Ku i \nand Cao states, were still placed at the end of the Airs of the various feudal states. This only goes to \nshow that poetry ought never be neglected. After all, si-poetry, originated from the reality of one \u2019s \nemotions and sentiments exuding from between ex clamations and sighs.130 Among them there are \nthose that [involve] the higher exhorting those below and those below eulogizing those above. A \ncultivated gentleman should especially make use of what is relevant to the civilizing of the world and is \nin accorda nce to the correctness of the Airs and Odes.131 The Imperial Ming reigns over the world \nand [its influence] spreads within and beyond the seas, and none do not become its vassal. We the \nChos\u014fn have received civilizing influence ( s\u014fnggyo/shengjiao ) for generations and our poetry, \ndocuments, ritual, and music possess the manner of manifest civility from antiquity.132 \n \nIn this articulation of poetry \u2019s indispensability, S\u014f established a series of correspondences.

Chos\u014fn \nis analogous to the feudal states of antiquity, but with one caveat \u2014 while Cao and Kui are \ninsignificant states, Chos\u014fn maintained a direct link to t he classical past, a point significant for \nunderstanding the rhetorical power of this preface.  \nS\u014f invoked the classical paradigm of poetry as expression of authentic sentiment to speak to \nits ability to reflect the governance of the times. Good poetry emer ged from good times \u2014the Ming, \noverseeing an age of virtue was no exception. The Chos\u014fn produced good poetry, because it had \nreceived \u201ccivilizing influences\u201d ( s\u014fnggyo ) for generations. The civilizing influence here, again, is \nambiguous. It could originate f rom the Ming, but the deep time the preface evokes, and his assertion \nthat Chos\u014fn inherited the legacies of antiquity could also mean that the civilizing influence came \ndirectly from classics. In this preface, the arrival of these envoys was less an expres sion of Ming \ninfluence, than it was a reiteration of the normative status of classical ideals embodied in their \nsymbolic re -enactment. Explicit evocations of the classical paradigms of the Great Preface  of the Book \nof Songs thus granted diplomacy an ulteri or purpose:  \nThe Sagely Son of Heaven has emerged to carry on the Mandate of Heaven, and his light ascends to \njeweled throne.

In this prescription, poetry should not be \nthe idle musings of  the belles-letterist,  but a vehicle for producing morally edifying resonan ces. It also \ntailored the moral purpose of the literary to fit the political positional of the Ming envoy.

While ostensibly a service for th e literary reputations of these Ming envoys, the printing of \nthe Brilliant Flowers  co-opted Ming envoy desires for literary reputation to construct a platform for \nChos\u014fn \u2019s own self -representation.  \nTo be sure, S\u014f K\u014fj\u014fng deftly wove these prerogatives togeth er, using the language of the \nclassics as a unifying thread.

W hen Chos\u014fn officials and Ming envoys played to this classical model in these \nencomiums of Ming empire, Ming authority is in turn legitimated by making Ming envoys analogues \nto their counterparts of yore. In other words, Ming authority is mediated by its re lationship to the \nclassical past. This mediation was a fundamental qualific ation of Ming authority; for now,  political \nrecognition of the Ming \u2019s superiority was contingent on an ascription of classical normativity to the \nMing emperor and his state, and not  an automatic and unequivocal acceptance of Ming authority per \nse.  \n                                                 \n135 \u5c45\u6b63\u7aca\u5ff5  \u8a69\u4e09\u767e\u7bc7  \u53e4\u4e5f  \u56db\u7261\uff0c\u7687\u83ef  \u7686\u9063\u4f7f\u81e3\u800c\u4f5c  \u5176\u8a69\u66f0  \u738b\u4e8b\u9761\u76ec  \uf967\u9051\u5553\u8655  \u53c8\u66f0  \u8f09\u99b3\u8f09\u9a45  \u5468\u7230\n\u54a8\u8acf  \u592b\u53d7\u5929\u5b50\u4e4b\u547d  \u99d5\u56db\u7261  \u99b3\u539f\u96b0  \u5e38\u82e5\uf967\u53ca \u5247\u51e1\u6240\u4ee5\u5ba3\u4e0a\u5fb7\u800c\u9054\u4e0b\u60c5  \u8a62\u54a8\u8acf\u5ea6\u8005  \u5b9c\u7121\u6240\uf967\u76e1\u5176\u5fc3  \u6b64\n\u7687\u83ef\u5927\u592b\u4e4b\u6240\u4ee5\u7232\u8ce2  \u800c\u5468\u96c5\u4e4b\u6240\u4ee5\u7232\u76db\u4e5f  \u4eca\uf978\u5148\u751f\u4e4b\u624d\u4e4b\u7f8e  \u537d\u5468\u96c5\u4e4b\u5927\u592b  \u5176\u8a69\u537d\u56db\u7261\uff0c\u7687\u83ef\u4e4b\u907a\u97ff  \u662f\n\uf900\u53ef\u4ee5\uf967\u5217\u65bc\u7687\u660e\u5236\u4f5c\u4e4b\u73ed\u4e4e  \uf978\u5148\u751f\u4e4b\u9084  \u5176\u4ee5\u662f\u7bc7  \u737b\u8af8\u5929\u5b50  \u64ad\u4e4b\u7d43\u8b0c  \u4ee5\u7e8c\u592b\u5468\u96c5\u4e4b\u6b63   \n136 Du Huiyue discuses this at length and expounds on several such examples in Mingdai wenchen chus hi Chaoxian , 72\u201380. \n \n 338  In this and other prefaces to the Brilliant Flowers , the legacy of antiquity becomes the \ntouchstone for assessing the moral and political authority of Ming empire, either as an ideal", "doc_id": "b1b197e8-e7da-4316-8691-6f3bb0cac88a", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "b150a8142d143c8ca0402cac21dd7b0357e2734859c2b33f46f4b3cdd7daff08", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 973372, "end": 975332}, "relationships": {"1": "f47394fe-94c7-4ac0-a316-a92b37a55a86", "2": "a50a3889-19df-4471-b16b-ff11ed24323c", "3": "bb01f5f2-56c2-4c85-a6d4-735d151265c7"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "bb01f5f2-56c2-4c85-a6d4-735d151265c7": {"__data__": {"text": "length and expounds on several such examples in Mingdai wenchen chus hi Chaoxian , 72\u201380. \n \n 338  In this and other prefaces to the Brilliant Flowers , the legacy of antiquity becomes the \ntouchstone for assessing the moral and political authority of Ming empire, either as an ideal for \nemulation, or a lofty example to be surpassed.

But, even as he acknowledged the\u201ceastward fl ow\u201d of civilization, he asserted that:  \nThe Eastern Kingdom, with territories heaven -drawn, occupied a place far by the sea \u2019s edge. It was, \nhowever, the place where Kija was enfeoffed and the place where Confucius had desired to live. It has \nlong deserved t o be called [a place of] ritual, righteousness, and manifest civility.139 \n \nYi Hwang has been described as being a proponent of strict adherence to the \u201ctribute system\u201d on \nthe basis of \u201cmoral righteousness.\u201d140 The assertion of Chos\u014fn \u2019s relations with the Ming in terms of \nmoral obligation in this preface, however, was accompanied by an unequivocal affirmation of \nChos\u014fn \u2019s own cultural attainments, one admired  by Confucius himself. Integrated with this rhetoric \nof political hierarchy was a claim of cultural parity, not one recently achieved, but one sustained for \ngenerations. The moral order that legitimized the Chos\u014fn \u2019s vassal status vis -a-vis the Ming was also \nwhat allowed them to be equals in civilization to the  Ming Chinese.  \nConclusion  \nThe panegyrics to empire in the Brilliant Flowers were a joint production between Ming \nenvoys and the Chos\u014fn officials who accompanied them through their sojourn in Korea.

Alongside narratives of the Ming \u2019s civilizing influence spreading to Korea \nwere also assertions of Chos\u014fn \u2019s coevality with the Ming. This obser vation is particularly startling, \ngiven the genre \u2019s role in asserting Chos\u014fn Korea \u2019s political fealty to the Ming. Even with the \nrepetition of h ackneyed tropes, these poems envisioned empire in a manner that accounted for \ndiverse ways  Korea, the Ming, and narratives of the civilizing process should fit together.  Instead of \na seamless reconciliation, what resulted from these negotiations was an overwriting, where the \ninvocation of a common classical tradition could sustain an appeal to the Ming \u2019s moral empir e. \nThe sublimation of these divergent views needed to work only long enough to maintain a \ntemporary coherence. Once the banquets and pleasure outings ended, and the envoy -poets returned \nto their respective native spaces, they were free to think as they w ould, though often bringing with \nthem a piece of the grand, if ephemeral, production they helped enact . None of the representations \nof empire was inherently true, though each participant may have had their own preferred \nnarratives.141 Nevertheless, the social and literary character of the Brilliant Flowers  could \naccommodate simultaneously different and even theoretically mutually exclusive narratives of \nsovereignty.

Far from it; it only raised its stakes. History became a \nsite of impassione d disputes as political factions employed  rival narratives of \u201ccorrect\u201d history to \nconstruct partisan identities.8 Driving these endeavors was something akin to what JaHyun Kim \nHaboush has called a desire to \u201cpossess history,\u201d in her discussion of popular historiography in \ncontemporary Korea. Chos\u014fn historiographers, in searching for orthodox ( ch\u014fng \u6b63) interpretations \nof the past to provide the moral basis for political legitimacy, share with their modern successors a \nview of history as a \u201cconfirmation of [ one\u2019s] ethical superiority and moral worth.\u201d9 For the Chos\u014fn \ncourt, this desire extended to representations of Korea both to and by outsiders.

All meetings between the Chos\u014fn ruler and it \u2019s officials had to be in the presence \nof a historian, a requirement that did not apply to the Ming emperor. The Veritable Records, once completed, were kept \nunder lock and key. Whereas the Ming Veritable Records  had been copied and leaked out of the palace even before the \ndynasty \u2019s fall, the Chos\u014fn  court retained control of that text through the end of the dynasty. Arguably, Chos\u014fn practice \nshowed a firmer commitment to maintain historical knowledge, but also exhibited a strong desire to limit access to the \ninformation it contained and control histo riographical discourse. These efforts, however, were not necessarily always \nsuccessful, as Chos\u014fn officials and literati came to contest official historiography with their own historical works.

For instance, history writing at the \nQing court fundamentally shaped modern Chinese perception s of Qing empire \u2019s territorial extent, \nbut also of the \u201cChina\u201d imaginary, in which past hegemony has come to sanctify current \nsovereignties.11 For those subject to such claims, such as the Vietnamese and Korean elites, \nAlexander Woodside has argued, \u201chistor y writing became a major form of \u2018boundary \nmaintenance \u2019 ....against Chinese hegemony.\u201d12 It was, however, not enough to demarcate a clear \nboundary between Korea and empire. Another parallel between the postcolonial context of history \nwriting in contemporary  Korea and the Chos\u014fn is the shared \u201c[yearning] to be major players on the \nworld scene....not at [its] periphery.\u201d Claiming this importance during the Chos\u014fn did not require \ntying Korea to the then anachronisms of modernity or the ethnic nation, but depend ed on links to \nConfucian civilization through a genealogy traceable to its vaunted antiquity.13 Since Korean elites in \nthe Chos\u014fn period sought recognition from their Ming counterparts as cultural equals, they could \nnot draw boundaries simply in antithesis to Chinese (imperial) hegemony. They instead carved out a \nspace that was defined in the terminology of hegemonic discourse. Negotiated and nuanced, these \nboundaries emerged from practices of resistance enunciating political and cultural claims in a way \nlegible an d palpable to imperial desires.  \n                                                 \nthis precise issue.

Kija, whom Han Young -woo has \ndescribed as a \u201ccultural symbol,\u201d was deployed for diverse purposes by Kor y\u014f and Chos\u014fn \nstatesmen in representing their relationship to the Ming and its predecessors. Among them, the \nSarim  scholar -officials (\u58eb\u6797 ) of the sixteenth century asserted, through Kija, Korea \u2019s independent \ntransmission of cultural and moral legitimacy fro m antiquity. Related ideas of the orthodox \n\u201ctransmission of the Way\u201d ( tot\u2019ong \u9053\u7d71 ) inscribed a political and cultural space for a Korea \nautonomous from Chinese imperial authority.14 On the other hand, Sarim reverence of Kija has also \nbeen attributed to their  being \u201cmired in an ideology of \u2018admiring China. \u2019\u201d15 How could Kija \nsimultaneously symbolize, for the same people, both Chos\u014fn \u2019s cultural dependence on \u201cChina\u201d and \nits political independence from it? Reconciling these two notions requires  distinguishing bet ween \n\u201cChina,\u201d as a transtemporal political imaginary of successive imperial dynasties and as a symbol for \nthe classical discourses and the civilizational values they described. In other words, Chos\u014fn, by using \nKija, delineated its claims of cultural distin ction and political autonomy within a discourse legible to \nthe Ming and its agents. Employing Kija as a symbol ensured recognition of Chos\u014fn inheritance of \nthe classical past, but it also implicitly made Chos\u014fn an object of the Ming \u2019s sovereign claims.

Both Korean \nofficials and their Ming vi sitors had to account for each other \u2019s points of view. Even though Ming \nenvoys were usually unacquainted with figures like Tan \u2019gun and Tongmy\u014fng, they were already \nfamiliar with Kija, a figure prominent in their shared repertoire of classics and histories. In the \ncourse of their literary exchanges, Ming envoys and their Chos\u014fn hosts grappled with divergent \ninterpretations of the p ast, which implicated how Korea \u2019s present with the Ming should be \nunderstood. Poetry exchange thus echoed a broader strategy of autoethnography in attempts to \nshape its image for imperial eyes. A quatrain differed only in scale, not in kind, from other, mo re \nextensive efforts the Chos\u014fn court made to represent its own past. History, both recent and ancient, \nbecame a site of strategic engagement, contestation, and reinvention.  \nThe social practice of envoy writing also oriented these historical contentions to  specific \nspaces. Envoy poems ( \u8a69), rhapsodies ( \u8fad\u8ce6 ), and prose accounts ( \u8a18) were often written in situ , or \npost facto in commemoration of a visit. These spaces could be more general locales \u2014the Yalu River, \n\u016ciju, Kwaksan, Anju, P \u2019y\u014fngyang, Kaes\u014fng, and the c apital Seoul \u2014but they could also be specific \nedifices or vistas, like a pavilion or, in the case of Kija, a tomb and a shrine. Seen in this light, a n \nenvoy poem, thus intertwined with spatial practice, was not a discrete literary enunciation, but one \nnode in a web of relationships formed with physical monuments, their inscriptions, historical \nwriting, and other envoy poems. While Kija \u2019s significance for Chos\u014fn history has been discussed at \nlength in scholarship, the social moment and physical site where divergent Chos\u014fn and Ming \ninterpretations of the Kija mythos could interact has yet to be discussed.16 \n                            ", "doc_id": "1c5648f7-6703-4a5b-a51d-93de6eb8040a", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "86d04aa35566ee275145cb8154474f60e026a7471c849b9759a64f7a15d4bd1d", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 999186, "end": 1001724}, "relationships": {"1": "f47394fe-94c7-4ac0-a316-a92b37a55a86", "2": "0f91b86e-8051-4838-890c-b2d44cc2393a", "3": "768b8257-b322-4b5f-a1a2-a62b064cc89d"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "768b8257-b322-4b5f-a1a2-a62b064cc89d": {"__data__": {"text": "been discussed at \nlength in scholarship, the social moment and physical site where divergent Chos\u014fn and Ming \ninterpretations of the Kija mythos could interact has yet to be discussed.16 \n                                                 \n16 Visits to the Kija shrine is treated briefly in Du Huiyue, Mingdai wenchen chushi Chaoxian, 59\u201360; an d Kim Han \u2019gyu \u91d1\n\u7ff0\u594e , Sa Chos\u014fnnok y\u014fn \u2019gu: Song, My\u014fng, Ch\u014fng, Sidae Chos\u014fn sahaengnok \u016di saryoj\u014fk kach \u2019i \uc0ac\uc870\uc120\ub85d  \uc5f0\uad6c : \uc1a1, \uba85, \uccad \n\uc2dc\ub300  \uc870\uc120  \uc0ac\ud589\ub85d  \uc758 \uc0ac\ub8cc\uc801  \uac00\uce58  (Seoul: S\u014fgang taehakkyo ch \u2019ulp\u2019anbu, 2011), primarily as Du puts it, a way to \ncelebrate \u201cbring Chos\u014fn and the Ming c loser\u201d through a celebration of this \u201cbridge\u201d of \u201cMing cultural influence or \nChinese civilization\u201d for Korea.

Whereas they sometimes ignored \nTan\u2019gun and Tongmy\u014fng completely, they always paid homage to Kija.18 Moreover, the degree of \ndeference they showed him was on par with the ritual obeisances performed for Confucius himself.19 \nThis deference was due not to his status as a historical Korean ruler, but to what he represented in \nthe classics. For instance, in the poem dedicated to Kija by the 1488 envoy Dong Yue, he stood for \ndynastic legitimacy, the moral prerogative of the remonstrating minister, and the transmis sion of \nclassical knowledge:  \nChopsticks of ivory \u2014so long ago, he left behind deep meaning;  \nPavilions and ponds \u2014how could he have rescued [him] from depravity?  \nWho could say that leaving one \u2019s hair loose and feigning lunacy  \nWere not sacrifices of the body to present a stalwart heart?  \nWith the Plan of Yu, he showed the Great Way,  \nAnd since antiquity, the Easterners look up to his legacy.  \nI have by chance come here to rest my horse gaze up his shrine,  \nTo offer a pour of osmanthus wine and fragrant drink.20 \n \nAlthough the poem is opaque from its liberal use of allusion, any educated member of the elite in \nKorea and China, would probably have instantly recognized this recapitulation of Kija \u2019s story in \n                                                 \n18 The dearth of poetry in the Hwanghwajip on Tan\u2019gun does not necessarily mean that they did not visit the shrines.

See Sanguo zhi  \u4e09\u570b\u5fd7  f.30, pp. 848 \u2013849. \n27 Kija\u2019s enfeoffment in Chaoxian was most likely a later, Han period fabrication, derived from anachronistic readings of \nolder texts.The most even -handed and thorough treatment of these issues is Jae -Hoon Shim, \u201cA New Understanding of \nJizi Chos\u014fn as a Historical Anachronism,\u201d Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies  62, no. 2 (December 1, 2002): 271 \u2013305. \nAccording to Shim, Kija did migrate to the northeast, but there \u201care no archaeological and textual grounds f or the story \nof Kija \u2019s eastward migration to Chos\u014fn.\u201d Kija \u2019s Old Chos\u014fn did not exist in the 2nd millennium BCE.

In \nthe wake of modernizing reforms and nascent ethno -nationalism, many Korean reformers rejected \nQing China not only politically, but also intellectually. For them, what the Qing represented \u2014the \nclassical past and the imperial traditions \u2014lost their relevance as a privileged discourse for staking \nmeaningful political claims. Kija was no longer an ancient sage representing universal moral \naspirations, but was, in the words of the Korean nationalist hi storian, Sin Ch \u2019aeho, merely a prince \nof \u201cChina\u201d (Kr: China; Jp: Shina \u652f\u90a3 ).33 The antiquity Kija represented was now narrowly \n\u201cChinese\u201d; its norms were no longer adequate to a universal model of civilization. Ideological \nrepudiation eventually escalated int o dismissal of historicity. Korean nationalism could \naccommodate no longer the idea that Kija, a Shang (and therefore Chinese) prince could have \nestablished a dynasty in Korea, and began to repudiated the factuality of Kija narratives in the \nclassical text s.34 Tan\u2019gun took Kija \u2019s place as a premier symbol of a transhistorical Korea,  a radical \nshift from the Chos\u014fn period, when Kija was usually accepted as historically grounded and Tan \u2019gun \ntreated as mythology.35 Whereas Tan \u2019gun still enjoys an unquestioned status as the progenitor of the \nKorean people in both North and South Korea, Ki ja has completely disappeared from popular \nhistorical imagination.36 \nThe rejection of the historicity of Kija \u2019s kingdom in Korea, generally current in Korean \nacademic circles today, has converged with the findings of modern philological and archaeological \n                                                 \n33 Sin\u2019s adoption of the Japanese word Shina \u652f\u90a3  is significant, as it signaled the demotion of \u201cChina\u201d fr om a \nwellspring of classical civilization to just another ethno -national entity on the world stage.  \n34 Schmid, Korea between Empires , 175\u2013188. \n35 Sun Weiguo, \u201cChuanshuo, lishi yu rentong: Tanjun Ch aoxian yu Jizi Chaoxian zhi suzao yu yanbian \u50b3\u8aaa\uff0c\u6b77\u53f2\u8207\n\u8a8d\u540c\uff1a\u6a80\u541b\u671d\u9bae\u8207\u7b95\u5b50\u671d\u9bae\u6b77\u53f2\u4e4b\u5851\u9020\u8207\u6f14\u8b8a ,\u201d in Cong zhoubian kan Zhongguo \u5f9e\u5468\u908a\u770b\u4e2d\u570b  (Beijing: Zhonghua \nshuju, 2009), 313 \u2013336.

While only very \nfew scholars insist that Kija in fact established a kingdom in Korea, many do assert that an eastward \nmigration of either Kija or a people tied to his name  did indeed take place . In this mainstream \ninterpretation, Kija \u2019s Chaoxian would have existed not in modern -day Korea, but in Manchuria.37 \nThis link then has occa sionally been used to strengthen the modern Chinese state \u2019s claims of \nhistorical territorial sovereignty over Manchuria, which has proved a sensitive issue.38 These moves, \nto expurgate Kija from Korean national history (despite his importance in the history  of Korean \nidentity formation)39 and to assert Kija \u2019s historicity in service of Chinese territorial sovereignty, are \nboth tied to contemporary irredentist nationalisms.

The logic at work in both these positions is to equate Kija with China, and to take Kija as \na figure for the \u201ceastward transmission\u201d of culture. What animates these debates over Kija was \nfundamentally an early twentieth century misreading of early modern uses of the Kija mythos .

Although the \ninterpreter misunderstood and presented him with \u201cblank scrolls\u201d instead, Gong happily received \nthem, for the y too provided him an opportunity to leave traces of his ink in Korea.41 The Chos\u014fn \nprovided a blank slate not only in the form of white paper and empty boards, but also the landscape \nitself. Ming envoys saw a land deliberately denuded of native literary signification.

Certainly these spatial practices built upon existing poetic \npractices, such as that of the ch\u2019aun (Ch: ciyun \u6b21\u97fb ), the matching of rhymes and themes by one \u2019s \npeers and predecessors, which con tributed to the repetition of similar themes in identical locales.51 \nAs the 1476 Ming envoy Qi Shun wrote when he passed by Shanhai pass en route  to Korea, \u201can \nenvoy from the central academy comes here once again; and loves to put old subjects in new \nverses .\u201d52 Ming envoys like him continued to read, comment on and respond to the verses of their \npredecessors during the whole length of their journey.

Poetic composition became a \nrecurring event whenever a Ming literatus came to Korea, which cultivated an aura of temporal \ndepth and natural regularity to di plomatic exchange. Ming envoys recognized that the visibility of \ntheir work in Korea could help secure for themselves lasting reputations, and they eagerly adorned \nKorean edifices and scenic vistas.

Ch\u014fng Saryong once interceded to keep Yi Saek \u2019s poem on King \nTongmy\u014fng in place. Arguing that the Ming envoy Ni Qian had once praised it, he asserted that it \nwas \u201cno inferior to the poem of Ch\u014fng [Chisang].\u201d62 Yi Saek \u2019s poem managed to do just that when \nit received the acclaim of the 1567 envoy Xu Guo \u8a31\u570b  (1527 \u20131596).63 The court thus selected \nonly what it considered the best pieces to both impress Ming visitors and play to their desire to \nadorn  Korean space with their writings. All in all, whatever the Korea Ming envoys saw had been \ncrafted for their gaze. The sparse literary adornment of these sites was a temporary fiction.  \nSpatial practice undercuts the stability of the seeming consonance of t he Kija mythos  and the \nMing envoy as civilizer. Three caveats come to the fore. First, the Chos\u014fn court was never a passive \naccessory to the envoys \u2019 whims. The relinquishing of the power to name was only momentary. Ming \nplaques monopolized Korean spaces, but once the en voys departed, Korean writing returned to \ntheir former places. The Chos\u014fn court maintained the fiction of the Ming as sole civilizer for only as \nlong as it needed to represent it to Ming envoys. Second, Kija \u2019s tomb and shrine, contrary to the \nrenamed hills  and vistas, was not a part of a denuded landscape, but in P \u2019y\u014fngyang, a site invested \nwith connections to a layered past that told a story of cultural and political continuity. These two \naspects, Korean intention and spatial context, point to the third is sue, that of inscriptional practice \nitself. Repeated in situ inscription imbued a site with a transtemporal significance. The significance of \nany single piece of verse was not localized in the discrete space of its composition and audience, but \nwas self -consciously one element in the imagined continuity of a broader  tradition. These point to a \nconcerted attempt to utilize space as a site of representation.

Before the nineteenth century, it was common to refer to Korea as \nthe \u201ccountry of Kija\u201d ( \u7b95\u5b50\u4e4b\u570b ). The connection appears self -evident partly because the name of \nthe Chos\u014fn dynasty matches the name of Kija \u2019s kingdom, Chaoxian. In turn, Chos\u014fn/Chaoxian (Jp: \nCh\u014dsen \u671d\u9bae ) have become synonymous with an idea of a transhistorical Korea in modern East \nAsian languages. The fixity of these associations today, along with t he importance of Kija for \nChos\u014fn \u2019s political ideology,  makes appreciating the once tenuous nature of this association difficult. \nThe identification of Chos\u014fn Korea with Kija was not a foregone conclusion, but one that resulted \nfrom an express cultural and diplomatic strategy of representation that produced and reinforced \nthese equivalences. To this effect, the sites of Kija \u2019s tomb, his shrine, and the spatial practice of \nMing envoy writing, all worked together to secure the authenticity of Chos\u014fn claims to his legacy.  \nChos\u014fn/Chaoxian had been used to refer to three ancient Northeast Asian states, which, \nsave the last one, are shrouded in mystery, without basis in archaeological or reliable philological \nevidence.64 Until the 1392 establishment of the Chos\u014fn dy nasty by Yi S\u014fnggye, this appellation had \n                                                 \n64 The last state, Wiman Chos\u014fn ( \u885b\u6eff\u671d\u9bae  194 BCE \u2013109 BCE), is also the first historically verifiable state that used \nthe name \u201cChos\u014fn/Chaoxian.\u201d Destroyed by the Han, there was no direct political continuity between it and the  polities \nthat emerged afterward. The commentaries to the Shiji hypothesize that \u201cChos\u014fn/Chaoxian\u201d was derived from the name \nof a river located there, but the actual location of Wiman Chos\u014fn was likely in Liaodong, not the Korean peninsula, \nleaving even ge ographical continuity between ancient Chaoxian and modern Korea debatable.

The two were \u201cChos\u014fn,\u201d a name laden with classical associations, and the unfamiliar \n\u201cHwany\u014fng\u201d ( \u548c\u5be7 ), the location of Yi \u2019s hometown.66 The Ming emperor predictably selected \n\u201cChos\u014fn [Chaoxian],\u201d calling it \u201cthe only beautiful name for the Eastern Barbarians,\u201d identifying \nKorea with Chaoxian of yore, implicitly linking it with Kija.67 \nEarlier states who ruled the Korean peninsula also claimed Kija \u2019s legacy, but other parties \nexplicitly challenged them. Kogury\u014f had a cult of Kija worship, likely as an ancestral deity, though \nChinese observers considered it a form of \u201cinordinate worship\u201d ( \u6deb\u7940 ).\u201d68 After Kogury\u014f \u2019s demise, \nrival claimants contested the link to Kija. At stake was who was Kogury \u014f\u2019s legitimate successor. In \nthe eleventh century, the Kory\u014f ruler Sukchong ( \u9ad8\u9e97\u8085\u5b97  r. 1095 \u20131105) constructed a Tomb of \nKija and other shrines dedicated to him in P \u2019y\u014fngyang as a part of a broader political alignment to \nKory\u014f \u2019s northern frontier. Kory\u014f, by w orshiping Kija, strengthened its self -identification as \nKogury\u014f \u2019s successor, and also of Kija \u2019s Chaoxian, as it looked north to Kogury\u014f \u2019s former territories \n                                                 \n65 The Kory\u014f system of nobility did use of titles such as the \u201cDuke of Chos\u014fn\u201d \u671d\u9bae\u516c . Nobl e titles were honorary, \noften linked to localities through their ancient plac e names. Chos\u014fn, then, was not  identified as an alternative name for \nthe Kory\u014f sta te.

If Ming envoys had their doubts, offering ritual and inscriptional recognition \nof Chos\u014fn \u2019s claims required only a momentary suspension of disbelief, but voicing those doubts \nrequired confronting an entire established tradition, one that their own predecess ors and peers had \nhelped construct.  \nEarly Chos\u014fn intellectuals based their confidence in Korean links to Kija on the authority of \nConfucian classics and the Shiji, but they still sought additional evidence from local, Korean sources \nto support the legitima cy of the connection. King S\u014fngjong once asked the governor of P \u2019y\u014fngan \nprovince to investigate the provenance of Kija \u2019s tomb, including when it first was asserted to be his \ntomb and what documentary basis existed for this assertion.88 The Veritable Records  does not record \nwhether this study was ever completed, so it is not known what, if anything was discovered. There \nwas likely little to be found. Lack of intervening textual evidence elicited some discomfort, evinced \nin repeated attempts to further corrobo rate Korea \u2019s Kija connection. The one -time governor of \nP\u2019y\u014fngyang and compiler of its earliest extant gazetteer, Yun Tusu \u5c39\u6597\u58fd  (1533 \u20131601), once \nwrote of the city: \u201cThe people who remain [here now] \u2014though we do not know from whom they \ndescended, they should  all be the progeny of those received this teachings.\u201d89 Since the evidence was \ncircumstantial, the reasoning was necessarily extrapolative. In his Records of Kija (Kija chi \u7b95\u5b50\u8a8c ), the \nassessments of past authorities worked as definitive textual evidence. In additional to well -known \nclassical texts, Yun went as fa r as to draw on the testimony of relatively recent scholars, such as the \nMing prince Zhu Quan ( \u6731\u6b0a  1391 \u20131448, better known as Hanxuzi \u6db5\u865b\u5b50 ) to support his \nclaims.90 \n                                              ", "doc_id": "2c60f1e9-e717-45ad-a301-17164751f5b7", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "1df411205bdcb9af8c4b7c09074bba6260a4884fb91f84e3ffae510d5ba4a9ee", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 1068175, "end": 1070535}, "relationships": {"1": "f47394fe-94c7-4ac0-a316-a92b37a55a86", "2": "fe9add55-146a-4494-bf7d-231de1167da6", "3": "4076d3d0-3e76-4b41-a735-824d12ae540e"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "4076d3d0-3e76-4b41-a735-824d12ae540e": {"__data__": {"text": " 1391 \u20131448, better known as Hanxuzi \u6db5\u865b\u5b50 ) to support his \nclaims.90 \n                                                 \n88 S\u014fngjong sillok  29:5b [1473/04/18#3].  \n89 \u4eca\u4e4b\u907a\u6c11  \u96d6\u4e0d\u77e5\u5176\u67d0\u4eba\u4e4b\u51fa\u81ea  \u61c9\u662f\u7576\u6642\u819a\u654f\u4e4b\u82d6\u88d4\u4e5f . \n90 \u201cPreface to the P \u2019y\u014fngyang Gazeteer\u201d from O\u016dm s\u014fnsaeng yugo  \u68a7\u9670\u5148\u751f\u907a\u7a3f  f.3 in HMC 41: 545b \u2013545d; see also \nKija chi , Asami 22.1 , f.1\u20132. \n \n 374  The Neo -Confucian scholar -official, Yi I \u674e\u73e5  (1536 \u20131584) drew on Yun Tusu \u2019s work to \ncompile the  True Annals of Kija  (Kija silgi \u7b95\u5b50\u5be6\u7d00 ). The conspicuous attention to veracity may very \nwell hint at a deeper discomfort with the evidential basis of  their accounts . Both Yi and Yun \nexplained that they were often asked to elaborate on what Kija had done in Korea, but could offer \nnothing beyond what was already known by everyone with a basic Confucian education. The True \nAnnals was meant to redress this issue. When the 1582 vice -emissary Wang Jingmin ( \u738b\u656c\u6c11  fl. \n1584) stayed in P \u2019y\u014fngyang, he was excited that he  could \u201clodge so close to Kija \u2019s ancient ruins,\u201d but \nregretted that he knew little about Kija \u2019s activities after he went east. He asked Yi I, who was his \nwelcoming emissary, about extant Korean records. Yi I produced a copy of his own True Annals  as \nhis an swer.91 Whether Wang \u2019s request stemmed from earnest curiosity or polite skepticism is \ndifficult to know, but Yi I \u2019s posthumous biographers took great pride at his response. Wang was \nsaid to have \u201csighed in admiration without end,\u201d and exclaimed in \u201csurprise d joy that \u2018there was no \ndocument like this in China. \u2019\u201d92 \nIn the True Annals, Yi relied on a methodology similar to Yun \u2019s, \u201cbroadly investigating books \nof classics, histories, and philosophers and assembling the facts and the discourses of sages and wise \nmen.\u201d93 This scholastic approach involved collecting existing materials, but its truth claims primarily \nrelied on what Yi took to be the authoritative appraisals of past \u201csages.\u201d94 Chos\u014fn scholars \nemployed a method of textual authentication that hinged on the trustworthiness of their informants \nrather than the independent evidentiary merits of their statements.

In particular, the tradition diverged \nregarding the significance of Kija \u2019s investiture in Chaoxian. When Chos\u014fn courtiers and Ming \nenvoys affirmed, both tacitly and explicitly, Kija \u2019s Chaoxian as a precursor to a transhisto rical Korea, \nthey also raised questions about how Kija \u2019s virtue was to be reconciled with imperial authority, \nwhich by extension, framed Korea \u2019s relationship to empire.

The \ninterpretation in the Shiji offered the most room to maneuver out of the quandary. In that versio n, \nKija ruled his domain without recognizing Zhou authority, but only at the generosity of the Zhou \nruler. Even though it could provide a model of political autonomy, it offered no room for Korean \npolitical agency.

A subtle syntactical \nchange in Py\u014fn \u2019s account made all the difference. Py\u014fn did not use the ve rb pulsin  (i.e. Ch: buchen \u4e0d\n\u81e3) in its causative sense, where the Zhou king \u201cdid not make [Kija his] subject\u201d out of \nmagnanimity, but instead used it describe Kija \u2019s own moral resolution of refusing to serve, which the \nZhou ruler \u201cfollowed\u201d ( su ki pulsin ch i chi/ sui qi buchen zhi zhi \u9042\u5176\u4e0d\u81e3\u4e4b\u5fd7 ).

For example, as late as the nineteenth century, when a Chinese observer \nquestioned a Chos\u014fn envoy on the practice of enacting harsh punishments on slaves, the envoy  replied, perhaps rather \ndisingenuously, \u201cthis is according to the teachings of Jizi.\u201d Han Young -woo, \u201cJizi Worship\u201d 357 \u2013371. \n \n 381  of autonomy.108 The trick then, was to erase the negative tinges of \u201cnot serving,\u201d buchen.

The Shiji must have erred, confusing Kija with a different Shang \nprince. Hong maintained that Kija never paid tribute to the Zhou and ruled his kingdom, Korea, as a \nsovereign.110 Korea \u2019s sovereignty was all its own, and Kija \u2019s story granted it classical sanction.

He framed his essay as a rebuttal to the famous Tang scholar -official Liu \nZongyuan \u2019s \u67f3\u5b97\u5143  (773\u2013819) well -known inscription celebrating Kija \u2019s life, but it was equally in \nconversation with Py\u014fn \u2019s stele and the dominant Korean interpretation.111 In his original tract, Liu \nclosed off the prose portion of his hagiography with a hypothetical counterfactual.112 He posited, if \nthe tyrant Chow had died sooner and if the Shang prince Wugeng ( \u6b66\u5e9a  fl. 11th century BCE)113 \nhad succeeded in restoring the Shang, Kija would have been the one to aid him in governing the \nrestored dynasty. Liu thus lamented Kija \u2019s misfortune, having been unable to bring his political goals \nto fruition because of external circumstances. Implicit in L iu Zongyuan \u2019s assessment was that \nlingering loyalty to his destroyed dynasty was the prime motivation behind Kija \u2019s actions.  \nThe problem with Liu \u2019s interpretation, according to Zhang, was that the moral virtue of Kija \nshould not be sought in loyalty to the  Shang, but rather in his commitment to a sense of moral and \npolitical order that transcended dynastic interests. Kija \u2019s great wisdom was in his understanding of \nthe will of \u201cheaven,\u201d which, for Zhang, was equivalent to \u201crational principle\u201d (Ch: li/ Kr: i \u7406). This \nunderstanding allowed Kija to recognize the Shang \u2019s demise as the inevitable outcome of \u201cheaven \u2019s\u201d \nwill. For these reasons, he transmitted the Great Plan  to King Wu, even though he had conquered the \n                                                 \n111 See 146 0 HHJ Asami v.5 f.5:25a \u201327a (ZBHJJ pp. 136 \u2013137);  Fengshi lu f.2, p. 20 \u201321; Like many other pieces of Ming \nwriting about Jizi, Zhang Ning \u2019s essay was inscribed at Jizi \u2019s shrine and made its way into Chos\u014fn period histories.

For Zhang, who argued  that it was possible to understand a man \u2019s \u201coriginal \nheart\u201d by following his later accomplishments, Kija \u2019s activities in Chaoxian were the best \ndemonstrations of what Kija \u2019s true ambitions were. When Wugeng and the Shang loyalists rebelled \nagainst Zhou au thority, Kija did not come to their aid, despite possessing the necessary abilities and \nmoral virtue. Instead, he remained in Chaoxian and  \n...taught the people with regulations and laws, inspired rituals and decorum, and nurtured those in the \nEastern land where he lived, as if he had [arrived] already possessing [this intention]. Moreover, only \nwhen he was invested there did the Way become known in Chaoxian. [He had been so successful that] \nby the time of King Cheng, it was said that the west was pacified a nd the east had submitted. Even the \nSage of Eastern Lu (i.e. Confucius) said that there was no shame for a gentleman to dwell there. If it \nwere not for the Master (i.e. Kija \u2019s) efforts in pacifying the land and guiding its people, how could it \nhave been tr ansformed as thoroughly as this?114 \n \nBy bringing \u201cregulations and laws\u201d and \u201crituals and decorum,\u201d Kija initiated the civilizing process in \nChaoxian. Kija \u2019s moral motivation lay in a commitment to the project of civilization, already \nrevealed when he first e laborated the kingly way to King Wu through the Great Plan . Zhang Ning \u2019s \nrecapitulation of the Kija story so far coincided with the Korean interpretations outlined above, but \nthey diverged on one key issue. Kija \u2019s activities in Chaoxian, which Zhang equate d with Korea, \nshowed that he had not simply \u201cforgotten about the [Shang] and happily followed the Zhou,\u201d for he \nhad never really submitted to the Zhou in the first place.

All of these things were the gift of the \nCentral State, the Zhou. Ah! How benevolent indeed was the Zhou!115 \n \nZhang Ning equated Kija \u2019s state with Chos\u014fn and recognized the existence of a transhistorical \nKorean state, but also saw Korea \u2019s civilization and independence, and Kija \u2019s continued worship all \nas the result of the Zhou rulers \u2019s benevolence. Identifying the Zhou, as the Central St ate, a title now \ninherited by the Ming, Zhang drew an implicit parallel line of descent and equivalence between the \nZhou and the Ming, i.e. China, represented by successive imperial dynasties. In one fell swoop, \nZhang robbed Chos\u014fn of any agency in its own  political determination, historical existence, and \ncivilization. Korea \u2019s very existence became a gift of China.  \nEach exchange of envoy writing could gravitate towards a different interpretation of the Kija \nlegend. The 1521 envoy Tang Gao, whose behavior a nd bearing during his trip to Chos\u014fn was \nimpeccable, and rare among Ming envoys to receive unanimous praise, also implicitly disputed the \ndominant Korean narrative, but did so indirectly. Rather than turn all of Kija \u2019s accomplishments \ninto a gift of the Zh ou, he wrote that \u201cKija was a guest [of the Zhou], and thus did not submit [or: \nwas made not to submit],\u201d and emphasized the mutual, reciprocal relations that resulted. Kija \u2019s \n\u201ccountry [was now] to begin and end with the Imperial Ming / with baskets of gif ts and tribute of \ntreasures\u201d going between them.116 For Tang, \u201cnot submitting [ buchen ]\u201d too was the gift of the Zhou, \nbut it was never Kija \u2019s original intention.

Whereas Tang excused Kija for \u201cnot \nserving ,\u201d Yi integrated it as a quality essential to Korean identity, consonant with  Kija\u2019s legacies of \nvirtue. This exchange encapsulated the range of possibilities the Kija mythos  enabled in the diplomatic \ncontext. Korean writers did not necessarily s ee Korea \u2019s identity as a \u201cland that does not submit\u201d to \ncontradict its status as a trib utary state. Instead, as Yi Haeng wrote, being a vassal to the Zhou in \nKorea, was in itself an expression of \u201cnot submitting.\u201d119 This insinuation makes no sense in the \ncontext of Early Zhou politics, since feudal lords were by definition \u201csubjects\u201d ( chen/sin) of the \nZhou rulers, but it worked in the Chos\u014fn -Ming context. By claiming long -standing historical \nautonomy, it constructed implicit limits to imperial sovereignty.  \nThe Kija mythos was not monolithic, but accommodated subtly divergent political claims that  \nembodied rather different historical narratives and understandings of Korea \u2019s place vis-\u00e0-vis the \nempire. Even as it came to be seen as a model for the institutions of tribute and investiture in \nChos\u014fn -Ming relations, defiance of the Zhou nevertheless rem ained a central component.

Denouncing the Yuan set up his denouement, a paean to the Ming \u2019s all-\nencompassing virtue.

It returned the area of \nP\u2019y\u014fngyang to Korea an act of munificence that distinguished the civilized and virtuous Ming from \nthe barbarous and immoral Mongol dynasty. The Ming not only guaranteed a lasting peace, but als o \ndiffused its cultural attainments, enabling Korea to achieve the heights of civilization he observed. \nThe logic at work was that Ming supremacy must be understood in terms of other imperial \npossibilities. Qi \u2019s critiques of the Sui and Yuan were not of mi litary action sui generis, but its failures \nand excesses. Wars of conquest, like those of the Tang celebrated in this poem , remained  legitimate \nexpressions of imperial authority.137 \n                                                 \n137 This account demonstrates the envoy \u2019s erudition, but his knowledge of Korea \u2019s history was limited to what was \ndocumented in Chi nese dynastic histories. An equally erudite Korean reader, familiar with Korean narratives, would have \nobjected to many elements in his poetic cycle. For example, the return of the territories annexed by the Yuan had \nnothing to do with the Ming; the Yuan h ad already returned them to Kory\u014f in 1290.KS f.30:21a \u2013b [1290/03 ch\u014fngmyo ]. \nThe Tang wars also had an entirely different meaning for Korean history, a prelude to the unification of the peninsula \nunder Silla ( \u65b0\u7f85  trad. 57 BCE \u2013935). Though the Tang destroyed the Kogury\u014f, according to the Samguk sagi of Kim \nPusik \u91d1\u5bcc\u8efe  (1075 \u20131151), the Silla eventually expelled the Tang forces. A conclusive peace was only broached when \nSilla offered to enter into tributary relations with the Tang. In this way, Silla transformed a  military victory over the Tang \ninto a political compromise that assured Silla \u2019s autonomy at the expense of ritual deference. From this historiographical \nperspective, the Silla preserved its autonomy vis -a-vis the Tang through a deft combination of militar y prowess and \ndiplomatic savvy.

Omission of the Silla -Tang wars allowed Qi to unequivocally \ncelebrate the Tang \u2019s military successes, understandable given Qi \u2019s focus on P\u2019y\u014fngyang. But, his sources, the Chinese \ndynastic histories, also presented him an entirely different perspective. They list only glorious Tang victories, which left a \ndefeated Silla with no choice but to offer its surrender.For example, see the depiction s of the battle of Maixiao fortress \nin Sima Guang, \u201cThe Tang Annals\u201d \u5510\u7d00  f.18 in Zizhi tongjian  f.81, p.6375. See also Ouyang Xiu, Xin Tang shu , f.220, \np.6197. The accuracy of both the Korean Samguk sagi  and the Chinese dynastic histories are thus still sub ject to dispute. \nFor example, see Sun Weiran and his rebuttal of the Samguk sagi \u2019s narrative in \u201cQiantan Tang Luo zhanzheng zhong de \n\u2018Maixiaocheng zhi zhan \u2019\u201d Dongbei shidi  2 (2010): 43 \u201344; Sun Weiran \u201cLi Jinxing zhengzhan Chaoxian bandao Shiji kao \nlun\u201d Master \u2019s Thesis, Yanbian University , 2010 . With the elision of Silla \u2019s successful resistance and his erroneous \naccount of P \u2019y\u014fngyang \u2019s return to Chos\u014fn, Qi could claim that the peace and autonomy Chos\u014fn Korea now enjoyed \nwas entirely due to the Ming virtue. At the hear t these divergences in the historical record was the question of Korea \u2019s \nautonomy in the face of empire.  \n \n 392  S\u014f K\u014fj\u014fng, Qi Shun \u2019s welcoming emissary, responded to this verse history with a pithy \nrebuttal. S\u014f too celebrated the Ming \u2019s civil virtue, but he inverted Qi \u2019s original rhetorical structure, \nand only returned to the subject of history towards the end of th e piece on line 29.

The term \u201cabusing th e martial\u201d ( tongmu/duwu  \u9ef7\u6b66 ) was loaded with negative \nconnotations and was usually reserved to condemn military adventurism  and vainglory .

He contested the \nimperial prerogative to carry out wars of conquest in the first place.  \nThe center of gravity shifted as their verse exchange unfolded. Eventually Qi and S\u014f \ngradually converged on a repudiation of these imperial wars of conquest. While Qi too came to \ndenounce the Tang \u2019s military adventures, S\u014f reminded the envoy of the disastrous defeats suffered \nby both Sui and Tang armies in their attempts to conquer Kogury\u014f.139 The celebration of what the \nempire could do was replaced with injunctions against what it should not.

Not only was his work  widely read during the early \nChos\u014fn, the clai ms it made anticipated those of the various Korean writers discussed in this \nchapter.141 \nAs a biographical sketch of the Tang ruler Taizong, it narrated his rise from a gallant prince \nto emperor and concluded with his death after his failed campaigns against Kogury\u014f. An injunction \nagainst hubris, the poem lamented that Taizong \u201chad already achieved martial success\u201d and should \nhave \u201cfollowed\u201d the example of sage rulers and \u201cextended civil virtue.\u201d142 Instead he squandered \nthese earlier accomplishments by trying to conquer, in Yi Saek \u2019s words, \u201cThe Three Han [i.e. Korea], \nthe land of Kija that does not submit.\u201d Since both the civil and the martial were treated as legitimate \ntools of imperial authority, his failure owed not to a preference for the martial per se, but rather the \nintemperance of the wielder. In this case, the invasion of Kogury\u014f violated an ancient precedent, set \nby King Wu, when he invested Kija as an independent ruler. This act, rather than legitimizing \nimperial irredentism, became a delimiter of the proper bounds of imperial  ambition. In Yi \u2019s account, \n                                                 \n140 Yi Saek, \u201cCh\u014fnggwan \u016dm\u201d \u8c9e\u89c0\u541f , Mogun sigo  \u7267\u96b1\u8a69\u85c1  f.2 in Mogun \u2019go \u7267\u96b1\u85c1  from HMC v.3:527b \u2013527c.  \n141 This is paralleled in their social connections. For instance, Py\u014fn Kyeryang was in turn Kw\u014fn \u2019s disciple, while Kw\u014fn \nwas S\u014f K\u014fj\u014fng \u2019s material grandfa ther.  \n142 \u5df2\u8e35\u6bb7\u5468\u6210\u6b66\u529f  \u5b9c\u8ffd\u865e\u590f\u6577\u6587\u5fb7 . This is an allusion to the \u201cCounsels of Great Yu\u201d  passage in the Book of \nDocuments ; Yu \u865e was the dynastic name of the Sage King Shun \u821c. The sage ruler Yu \u79b9 founded the Xia dynasty \u590f \n(c. 2070 \u20131600).  \n \n 394  Taizong became cautionary example.

In this sense, within the poem, Tang Taizong \u2019s military \nadventure becomes fundamentally illegitimate. As such, the poem is also a celebration of civil (and \nliterary) virtue at the expense of the martial.

Both Kory\u014f and later the Chos \u014fn had celebrated imperial auth ority and \nwere complicit in the construction of its grandeur, at least in writing. But, such panegyrics were \nattenuated by a careful delineation of what that majesty entailed. For Korea, empire was only \nlegitimate when it was \u201ccivil.\u201d  \nThe literary exchange  of the Brilliant Flowers  offered a definitive alternative to martial \nprowess. It was also a resolution to the contentions of the past.

The Ming could count on Chos\u014fn \u2019s \ndeclarations of allegiance and paeans to its virtue, only if empire was expressed in terms of its \ncivilizing power and cultural prestige, not military prowess or territorial dominion.

The story of being struck by an arrow to an eye might be apocryphal, as later Chos\u014fn commentators \npuzzled over the provenance of this story.

By accepting the historicity of this \nnarrative, Chos\u014fn and Ming officials reinvented a classical model that legitimized their peculiar \n                                                 \n145 1476 HHJ f.1:79b in SKCM pt.4, v.301:332a (ZBHHJ v.1, p. 269): \u6587\u7ae0\u4e00\u6d17\u524d\u671d\u968b\u5510\u964b . \n \n 396  arrangement. It allowed the Ming t o retain its moral authority as universal rulers of the civilized \nworld, while allowing for Chos\u014fn \u2019s own space within it.  \nThe repudiation of imperial militarism and the elevation of civil/literary rule worked hand in \nhand with the Kija mythos.  Not only was  Korea guaranteed its own, separate claims to political and \ncultural autonomy that was unquestionably civilized, but the empire was implicitly barred from \nextending its own claims over this particular piece of land. By assuring, in poetry and in discourse,  \nthat Ming sovereignty and its civilizing influence had already spread to Korea, the Chos\u014fn court \nanticipated any arguments the Ming could have had for justifying territorial expansion or direct \npolitical intervention. Chos\u014fn succeeded in manufacturing a s eemingly impossible arrangement in \nclassical imperial ideology: a civilized state that was beyond the pale of empire.  \nOf course, the history of Chos\u014fn -Ming relations demonstrate that any such arrangement \nwere never ironclad, and the Chos\u014fn court continuall y struggled with the diversity of Ming attitudes \ntowards Chos\u014fn.

But, it is precisely because of this \nuncertainty that these  counterclaims  are significant. Without the regular assertion of Chos \u014fn\u2019s own \ncounterclaims, Korea \u2019s fate in empire would depend only on the whimsies of imperial desire.  \n \n397 Conclusion  \nThis exploration of Chos \u014fn strategies and practices of diplomacy wit h the Ming has made \nthree main interlinked arguments. The first is that a large part of Chos \u014fn diplomatic strategy was \nabout shaping and changing narratives  of Korea\u2019s place in empire . The tributary system, the Ming \u2019s \nmoral empire, and Korea \u2019s perpetual lo yalty were all examples of narratives resulting from Korean \nself-representation. The second is that these representations were tied to techniques of knowing that \ninverted a dynamic of power asymmetry. Armed with knowledge of empire, the Chos \u014fn court could \nexercise  enormous agency in its dealing s with the Ming. The third is that empire, whether \nunderstood in terms  of institutions or persuasive discourses, emerged from co -construction. By co -\nconstructing empire , Chos \u014fn interpolated itself into the imperial tr adition. As a result, p reserving \nChos \u014fn Korea \u2019s political autonomy became  an essential expression of an imperial power \u2019s claim to \nmoral legitimacy.  \nThe perspectives we apply to the premodern past have inevitably been shaped by the \nnarratives offered by  historical actors themselves. W e describe Chos \u014fn-Ming diplomacy in terms of \nideas like sadae or through the institutions and discourses of the \u201ctribute\u201d and \u201cinvestiture\u201d party \nbecause historical actors have chosen to reify these particular concepts . This stu dy has attempted to \nhistoricize th is process by showing that these concepts endured  because they integral to the political  \nnarratives the Chos \u014fn court used to negotiate with the Ming. For Chos \u014fn Korea, the imperative was \nto distill a narrative of Korea and  empire that could guarantee Chos \u014fn\u2019s membership in the civilized \necumene, while preserving the sanctity of its sovereign claims as an independent state.  \nThese narratives worked in a context wh ere alternative interpretations. How Ming and \nChos\u014fn maintained  simultaneous claims as heirs to the classical tradition is a case in point. These \nclaims could coexist because both parties constructed an idealized political imaginary by reenacting \n \n 398  the past through ritual and literary production. What in turn enabled th is co-construction was not so \nmuch a coherent reconciliation, but rather the polyvalency and polysem y of the discourses and \nsymbols involved . Just as the name for the the hostel for imperial envoys outside of the gates for \nSeoul, Mohwagwan (\u6155\u83ef\u9928 ) could be i nterpreted as either \u201cadmiring civilization hall\u201d or \u201cadmiring \nChina hall,\u201d many of the tropes and symbols of diplomatic discourse could both refer to the \nlegitimacy", "doc_id": "1cd1b1f6-dbd7-406f-8b73-a59ea064e404", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "c0cbab85331c4364e465a6d5c1918a0f5b70dc4fc72ec0a7bb845fdffa392b3b", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 1133318, "end": 1136437}, "relationships": {"1": "f47394fe-94c7-4ac0-a316-a92b37a55a86", "2": "c68ef578-0958-4c78-bf6d-5db788792f80", "3": "f8cef877-e6e6-4cea-a619-a75cb4233e03"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "f8cef877-e6e6-4cea-a619-a75cb4233e03": {"__data__": {"text": "the gates for \nSeoul, Mohwagwan (\u6155\u83ef\u9928 ) could be i nterpreted as either \u201cadmiring civilization hall\u201d or \u201cadmiring \nChina hall,\u201d many of the tropes and symbols of diplomatic discourse could both refer to the \nlegitimacy of Ming imperial claims or Chos \u014fn\u2019s own independent inheritance. When different actors \ncame together, they intervened on a pre -existing tradition with established conventions and \nprecedents. What they produced also worked in the register of the social; it was never essential for \nthe participants to share each other \u2019s vision of the world. As Pet er Galison puts it, \u201ctwo groups can \nagree on rules of exchange even if they ascribe utterly different significance to the objects being \nexchanged; they may even disagree on the meaning of the exchange process itself.\u201d So long that \n\u201clocal coordination\u201d occu rs \u201cdespite vast global difference,\u201d a diplomatic transaction could mean \ndifferent things to its participants without undercutting its efficacy.1 \nMeanings then, were not so much ambiguous as they were superimposed, to borrow a \nconcept from quantum mechanic s. One might ask, did performing a particular ritual or using a \nparticular turn of phrase mean Chos \u014fn was part of the Ming empire? The answer could be yes, no, \nboth, or neither \u2014the \u201ccorrect\u201d answer depends on the motivations and goals of the observer. The \nChos \u014fn and the Ming (and later the Qing) could theoretically tell themselves wildly different  \nversions of the story without any unifying cohere nce, so long as the signs these stories used were \nlegible to one another . This arrangement, however, could only b e stably maintained if diplomacy was \nstrictly bilateral and other channels of communication were unavailable. Once previously excluded \nthird-party observers entered the picture, this dichotomous superimposition was no longer possible. \n                                                 \n1 Peter Galison, \u201cTrading Zone: Coordinating Action and Belief,\u201d in The Science Studies Reader , ed.

That is not to discredit \nmodern discourses of sadae, but rather to point out that the overwhelming negative connotations the \nconcept has si nce taken on, often did not apply to Chos \u014fn.

Th e Chos\u014fn remained legible to the Ming court, all the while concealing \ncrucial details of its social and political organization, its history, and its culture. The triumph of Ming \nuniversalism was fashioned to be as complete as possible, even as the Chos\u014fn c ourt and its agents \nmade sure to preserve its own line of legitimacy, cultural transmission, political autonomy within it. . \nIt was a strategy to manipulat e of empire.  \nIn retrospect, we can also think of Korean knowledge production in terms of an \u201carchive o f \nempire.\u201d There was a literal archive, the wood -and-tile facilities where the Chos \u014fn stored them, but \nhere I point to a figurative form, where the organization of these documents and compilations grant \nthem their archival character. As archives, to borrow  the wording of Ann Stoler, they are \u201cactive, \n                                                 \n5 See for instance, the portrayal of Chos \u014fn-Ming relations in the popular film directed by Chu Changmin [Choo Chang -\nmin] \uc8fc\uc7a5\ubbfc , Kwanghae, Wang i toen namja \uad11\ud574 : \uc655\uc774  \ub41c \ub0a8\uc790  [Masquerade] (CJ Entertainment, 2012)  \n \n 401  generative substances with histories,\u201d whose documents too have \u201citineraries of their own,\u201d and take \non a distinctive \u201carchival form\u201d detectable in its repetitive refrains, means of persuasion, and the \nmodes of  rationality they espouse. The Korean \u201carchive of empire\u201d is admittedly minuscule, \nespecially compared to the vast brick -and-mortar Dutch colonial archives. A more fundamental \ndistinction, however, lies not in a matter of size or medium, but the kind of kn owledge they \nconstituted.6 \nThe Korean archive, like those of modern colonialism, emerged from a dynamic of power \nasymmetry, but with two key points of difference. The first is that it was not the handmaiden of  \nmetropolitan, imperial desires.  Instead, these  diplomatic missives, interpreter manuals, poetry \nanthologies, and envoy travelogues, comprised the knowledge of managing empire from its \nperiphery.7 This Korean \u201carchive of empire\u201d also far exceeded in scope of what the Ming and Qing \nkept about Korea.

Did manipulating the symbols of empire do what it \nwas intended to do? Did Chos \u014fn Korea manage to change its place in the imperial tradition? These, \nI believe, should be thought of as open questions; without  the benefit of alternative timelines and \nparallel realities, it is impossible to test these propositions rigorously. Nonetheless, how Korea \u2019s \nrelations with the Ming and Qing empires in the centuries that follow do offer some points for \nconsideration. Let  us return to the sixteenth century, to 1592, to the outbreak of the Imjin War.  \nToyotomi Hideyoshi \u2019s invasion of Korea was not initially conceived as an attempt to \nconquer Korea per se. He had much grander designs, seeking to unify the known world under hi s \noverlordship. His primary target was not Chos \u014fn Korea, but the Ming. Before his troops landed in \nPusan in the spring of 1592, Hideyoshi had dispatched envoys to Chos \u014fn to coax the Korean court \ninto supporting his grand plan. The Chos \u014fn rebuffed them. In the court \u2019s words, aiding Hideyoshi \u2019s \nventure would be akin \u201cto a son turning against its father; \u201d for Korea, a loyal vassal of the Ming to \n                                                 \n9 I suspect this inversion of the colonial imperial dynamic was likely quite pr evalent in pre -19th century imperial \nformations, where local, peripheral actors relied on asymmetries of knowledge to counterbalance the power at the \ndisposal of their erstwhile superiors in the imperial center.  \n10 Contrast this with the", "doc_id": "9d168aac-4584-42c1-8d12-677383c95401", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "062d61eee13b851d3765110ed50393f898646863bc80969fe4889d4a0b62073f", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 1145513, "end": 1148472}, "relationships": {"1": "f47394fe-94c7-4ac0-a316-a92b37a55a86", "2": "b8cb6b73-95bf-47d3-879f-749f2c527b8b", "3": "86bb6211-5e92-46e8-a02e-a0598d8cf015"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "86bb6211-5e92-46e8-a02e-a0598d8cf015": {"__data__": {"text": "I suspect this inversion of the colonial imperial dynamic was likely quite pr evalent in pre -19th century imperial \nformations, where local, peripheral actors relied on asymmetries of knowledge to counterbalance the power at the \ndisposal of their erstwhile superiors in the imperial center.  \n10 Contrast this with the ethnographic mode c ommon in accounts of Korea in imperial dynastic histories, whose \noutdated information remained the basis of Ming perceptions of Chos \u014fn.

There were even talks of partitioning the Korean \npeninsula between Hideyoshi and the Ming. Although the Ming never seriously considered these \nproposals, knowledge of such discussions led to much constern ation at the Korean court.28 \nOne major, but subtle (and therefore overlooked) effect of the Imjin War was  how it shifted \nthe delicate balance between the asymmetry of power and the asymmetry of knowledge. This \nbalance, which the Chos \u014fn court had cultivated carefully over the past two centuries had been \nseverely disrupted. For the first time in centuries, hundreds of thousands of imperial subjects \u2014\nsoldiers, officials, traders \u2014set foot in the peninsula.

No longer a faraway land , whose vistas had only \nentered the eyes of an occasional imperial emissary, Korea was now vi sible to the imperial gaze in a \nqualitatively different way. Even after the Japanese threat abated, the rise of Nurhaci and the \nJianzhou Jurchens (later the Manchus) made Korea a key consideration in Ming strategic calculus.29 \nKorea \u2019s importance to the Ming  was no longer merely ideological. Once the Ming focused its gaze \non Korea, the Chos \u014fn court could no longer count on imperial inat tention . \nThe ramifications of this shift are enormous. After the war, for the first time in two \ncenturies, the Ming court int ervened directly in matters of Korean succession. It refused the \ninvestiture of King Kwanghae, because Ming officials wished to enforce a rule of primogeniture in \ndynastic succession.30 When the Manchu threat grew, Ming officials even proposed to send Vicer oys \n(\u76e3\u570b ) to oversee Korean military preparations.31 The Chos \u014fn protested these interventions, but \nwhat is clear is that the Imjin War set what Chos \u014fn considered a dangerous new precedent.

Th e Manchu invasions of Korea serves as the best \nillustration of this effect. When the Qing emperor Hong Taiji (r. Qing Taizong \u6e05\u592a\u5b97   1626 \u2013\n1643) invaded in 1636, he outmaneuvered Chos \u014fn\u2019s defenses and besieged the Korean king at the \nmountain fortress of Namha n. The Chos \u014fn king capitulated and agreed to a humiliating surrender. \nFor the first time since the Kory \u014f, a Korean monarch prostrated before a foreign ruler to pay his \nobeisance. Hong Taiji then withdrew with his armies. He brought with him captives, hosta ges, and \nbooty, but he was content to leave the Chos \u014fn state intact. Unlike the Mongols of the thirteenth \ncentury, he left no overseers or soldiers to enforce Korea \u2019s compliance. Hong Taiji continued to war \nwith the Ming and his descendants went on to conq uer China and much of Inner Asia, but left \nChos \u014fn to its own devices.

Why didn \u2019t the Manchus conquer Korea, when it clearly had the \nwherewithal?  \nHong Taiji certainly had his own strategic calculations. Korea may not have been worth the \ntrouble if he had hi s eyes set on a grander prize. But, before Hong Taiji left, he commissioned a \nmassive stele to be erected in the Chos \u014fn capital. Korean literati officials were responsible for \ndrafting its text. In it, the Manchu invasion was rewritten as a n august display  of martial and civil \nvirtue. Korea submitted willingly and all this demonstrated his magnanimity as a sage emperor.32 \nHaving so recently assumed the title of emperor (Ch: huangdi \u7687\u5e1d ), which in Chinese language texts \n                                                 \n32 The stele in question is the Samj \u014fndo stele ( \u4e09\u7530\u6e21\u7891 ), also known as the \u201cAccomplishments of the Great Qing \nEmperor\u201d stele \u5927\u6df8\u7687\u5e1d\u529f\u5fb7\u7891 . The University of California \u2019s Asami collection holds a rubbing of the stele.  \n \n 410  now replaced his former inner Asian styl e of Kaghan (Ch: kehan \u53ef\u6c57 ), Hong Taiji was eager to \nlegitimate his claim to the imperial tradition . Hong Taiji saw more value in the idea of Korea as one \nmajor component of the imperial tradition itself than as territory to be appended to his dominion. \nAs Wang Yuanchong has argued, Hong Taiji wished to enforce tributary relations with Korea as a  \nway to fashion himself as the rightful claimant to the mandate of heaven.33 To be the tradition \u2019s \nplausible successor, he had to acquire all its symbols of legitimac y, which included paraphernalia like \nthe imperial calendar, dynastic reign titles, not to mention the lost seal insignias of the First Qin \nemperor and Chinggis Khan.  Claiming the Ming \u2019s former vassals as his own, then was a way to \ndisplace the Ming as the legitimate master of the ecumenical world.  \nWe can preserve Hong Taiji \u2019s logic by wording it slightly differently, a rearrangement with \nstartling results. If tribute missions from Korea were an essential component of imperial \nlegitimation, then, it follows whomever Koreans decided to paid tribute to was likely the legitimate \nSon-of-Heaven. Could it be also that, an empire that cannot earn Korea \u2019s allegiance, was no true \nempire at all?34 In many ways, this logic echoed the narratives Kory \u014f memorial writers pli ed to their \nMongol overlords. They legitimized Kory \u014f\u2019s relative autonomy in the Mongol imperium by claiming \nthat Korea \u201cwas the first to submit \u201d to Khubilai Khan, who therefore rewarded the Kory \u014f with \nperpetual autonomy.35 Hong Taiji \u2019s move, then, had its a ntecedents in the imperial tradition.  \nBut, viewed against the long history of empire in East Asia, this", "doc_id": "e2b96827-b574-417f-b811-4e6e1240b24d", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "1be47adf29f6b22f748c606f880df84571fd5d66cd9ef94c53bec4e4c1f7a06f", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 1167307, "end": 1170167}, "relationships": {"1": "f47394fe-94c7-4ac0-a316-a92b37a55a86", "2": "6d32dad0-f940-472b-bf71-0af775c510ad", "3": "2c2c49bc-341d-46f3-bdc3-fb524ae204c9"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "2c2c49bc-341d-46f3-bdc3-fb524ae204c9": {"__data__": {"text": "\u201cwas the first to submit \u201d to Khubilai Khan, who therefore rewarded the Kory \u014f with \nperpetual autonomy.35 Hong Taiji \u2019s move, then, had its a ntecedents in the imperial tradition.  \nBut, viewed against the long history of empire in East Asia, this move was not his only \navailable option.

It was a military defeat, which signaled to many \nthe failure of the Qing \u2019s self -strengthening movement, but the loss of Korean allegiance, among other things, may have \nshaken the very foundations of Qing legitimacy and the imperial tradition itself.

By the Ming and the Qing, this idea was no longer tenable. What \nreplaced it was the notion of Korea as the empire \u2019s most loyal vassal, whose regular devotion \nvalidated the imperial project. For this mechanism of legitimation to work however, Korea had to \nremain independent. Hong Taiji, of course, coerced Korea to submit, but by leaving his stele behind, \nhe was content enough that Korea \u2019s submission be narrated, in perpetuity, as their willing \nrecognition of his virtue and destiny.  \n*** \nIn August 2007, on Ti eba, a popular Chinese social media forum, a netizen posted a series of \nquestions about Chinese history.

If \nKorea wasn \u2019t next to China, but was next to a country like Portugal or Rome, it certainly would have \nbeen destroyed a long time ago.\u201d36 \nIn this response, the anonymous netizen  offered , in a nutshell, a grand theory of \ncomparative empire.

It is also implicit in elucidations of the tributary system contemporary scholars have \noffered. It is also, what I have called, the Whig history of Chinese empire.  \nThis perspective  rests on a teleological reading of imperial history, one in which historical \ndevelopment is perceived as the inevitable outcome of the essential values of an imperia l ideology. \nFor the British empire, it is the march of market -driven liberalism; for the Chinese empire, it is the \nidea of cultural superiority, magnanimity and non -interference. Just as the former has become an \nessential part of British national identity,  the latter has become so for the identity of modern China. \nThe idea of China \u2019s moral empire is deeply ingrained in how modern Chinese perceive China in the \ninternational order. What this dissertation shows, however, is that this particular notion, as it a pplies \nwas in  many ways a Korean production.  \nThis Whig history of empire exists in part because it had been constantly reinforced by \ngenerations and over centuries. Its plausibility to modern Chinese audiences today is not only \nbecause of its prominence in  nationalist discourses or in selective readings of the imperial past, but \nbecause for centuries, Korean diplomats have been repeating this narrative to modern China \u2019s \nimperial forebears. In hindsight, the sheer volume of utterances in support of this narr ative makes it \nappear qualitatively true. What is lost, of course, when one proceeds from these assumptions is what \npurpose this discourse really served for the Korean diplomats who had used them. Viewed from the \nvantage of Chos \u014fn diplomats and memorial dr afters, Korea \u2019s survival owed not to some essential \nquality of the Chinese or even the imperial tradition as a whole. It owed instead to their efforts in \nconvincing emperors and their agents that the best way to be imperial was to behave according to \n\u201cprop riety and righteousness.\u201d And, to do so, they invested greatly in an image of moral empire.  \n \n \n 413  Bibliography  \nPrimary Sources  \nAcademia Sinica. \u201cGrand Secretariat Archives (Neige daku dang \u2019an \u5167\u95a3\u5927\u5eab\u6a94\u6848 ).\u201d Taipei, \nFusinian", "doc_id": "08d1a37d-3d06-4cd6-810b-7954085ab8ea", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "50244221e2356af2a7b56e4f01cb8e6ae5da3c7b73104e70b15dfa68f550a2b5", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 1173052, "end": 1175853}, "relationships": {"1": "f47394fe-94c7-4ac0-a316-a92b37a55a86", "2": "2c2c49bc-341d-46f3-bdc3-fb524ae204c9", "3": "fc111a9c-551b-4842-b1e0-5d0c2f06d78d"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "fc111a9c-551b-4842-b1e0-5d0c2f06d78d": {"__data__": {"text": "And, to do so, they invested greatly in an image of moral empire.  \n \n \n 413  Bibliography  \nPrimary Sources  \nAcademia Sinica. \u201cGrand Secretariat Archives (Neige daku dang \u2019an \u5167\u95a3\u5927\u5eab\u6a94\u6848 ).\u201d Taipei, \nFusinian Library, n.d. 106204; 287678; 117451; 056 317. \nBan Gu \u73ed\u56fa .

A comprehensive and authoritative of discussion \nthese trends\u2019 implications for the historiography of East Asia is desirable, but the \nconsiderable scholarly output of the last decade far exceeds what can be \nresponsibly addressed in the scope of one essay. This discussion, then, will \nfocus on several key issues relevant to the history and historiography of Korea \nand its place in early modern East Asia.\nIt will consider once prevailing historiographical approaches to interstate \nrelations, such as \u201cthe tributary system\u201d and \u201cthe Chinese World Order,\u201d in light \nof recent approaches in transnational and comparative history. These approaches, \nwith their emphasis on \u201cconnectivity \u201d and \u201cco-construction, \u201d can highlight the \nroles of material and knowledge exchange, and of cultural, literary, and ritual \npractices in dynamically shaping relationships between countries and societies that \nmight otherwise appear to be structurally predetermined. \nThe discussions here suggest also the value of writing Korean history with an \neye to potential dialogue with other disciplinary and \u201carea studies \u201d fields. Not \nonly can Korean history draw from paradigms and approaches developed \nelsewhere, but research in Korean history can also contribute to their \ndevelopment, especially in methodological or theoretical terms. This potential, \nhowever, is undercut by a certain paradox. Shared paradigms and scholarly \nvocabulary are prerequisites to effective exchange, but such dialogue tends to \nrely on the deployment of Western-language origin terminology and concepts, \nsuch as \u201cnation, \u201d \u201cempire \u201d and \u201csovereignty, \u201d to give a few examples. The task \nat hand then is to develop paradigms and analytical approaches that make \nexplicit the accompanying risks of using \u201cforeign \u201d terminology and the process \nof their translation, while fulling exploiting the opportunities of communication \nthey open up.

In a departure from pre-Mongol period practices, new court ritu-\nals emphasized the Yuan emperor\u2019s superiority over the Kory\u014f king and \ncodified Korea\u2019s integration into its universal imperial order. Korean rul-ers relinquished many symbols of Kory\u014f political autonomy.15 As widely \nnoted in existing scholarship, Kory\u014f\u2019s rulers now represented them-\nselves as vassals of a universal emperor, a shift with consequences for Korean relations with the Ming and Qing empires during the Chos\u014fn dynasty (1392-1910).16\nThe ritual transformation of Korean kingship, however, had ramifica-\ntions beyond Korean royal politics or Kory\u014f-Mongol relations per se. It \nalso had lasting effects for China\u2019s imperial tradition as a whole. Here, \nthe imperial tradition refers to two distinct notions, that are often \n intertwined in practice. The first is the concept of zhengtong (ch\u014fng -\nt\u2019ong \n\u6b63\u7d71 ), which tied political authority to a diachronic transmission \nthrough a line of previous imperial dynasties.17 The second, broader \nview of the imperial tradition points to the repertoire of political tech-\nnologies tied to this genealogical notion of legitimacy.18 These political technologies could take the form of institutions such as civil service ex -\naminations, court rituals, and a Confucian-style bureaucracy, or articu-lations of political ideals in the image of a Sage King and the civilizing \n15)\u2002No My\u014fngho \ub178\uba85\ud638,  Kory\u014f kukka wa chiptan \u016disik: chawi kongdongch\u2019e, Samguk yumin, \nSamhan ilt\u2019ong, Haedong ch\u2019\u014fnja \u016di ch\u2019\u014fnha \uace0\ub824 \uad6d\uac00\uc640 \uc811\ub2e8 \uc758\uc2dd: \uc790\uc704 \uacf5\ub3d9\uccb4, \uc0bc\uad6d \n\uc720\ubbfc, \uc0bc\ud55c \uc77c\ud1b5, \ud574\ub3d9 \ucc9c\uc790\uc758 \ucc9c\ud558 (The National and Community Consciousness of the \nKory\u014f: Autonomous Community, Leftover Subjects of the Samhan, Unified Samhan, and the \nRealm of the Son-of-heaven of Haedong) (Seoul: S\u014ful", "doc_id": "c4a642b8-6a79-4adc-8009-7bd08747e984", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "802a5a99d01d316502eba7111c722fa2de62211206452b1bbcb8be4296ca69b6", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 10032, "end": 12465}, "relationships": {"1": "00258040-b523-4142-b9eb-c8caff7e5667", "2": "2b82b055-b1ec-4d29-922e-f02ec263df0a", "3": "658930cd-ce7b-4da3-a902-7c16093ba8ac"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "658930cd-ce7b-4da3-a902-7c16093ba8ac": {"__data__": {"text": "wa chiptan \u016disik: chawi kongdongch\u2019e, Samguk yumin, \nSamhan ilt\u2019ong, Haedong ch\u2019\u014fnja \u016di ch\u2019\u014fnha \uace0\ub824 \uad6d\uac00\uc640 \uc811\ub2e8 \uc758\uc2dd: \uc790\uc704 \uacf5\ub3d9\uccb4, \uc0bc\uad6d \n\uc720\ubbfc, \uc0bc\ud55c \uc77c\ud1b5, \ud574\ub3d9 \ucc9c\uc790\uc758 \ucc9c\ud558 (The National and Community Consciousness of the \nKory\u014f: Autonomous Community, Leftover Subjects of the Samhan, Unified Samhan, and the \nRealm of the Son-of-heaven of Haedong) (Seoul: S\u014ful taehakkyo ch\u2019ulp\u2019an munhwaw\u014fn, 2009), 133\u201354.16)\u2002For some examples, see Peter Yun, \u201cRethinking the Tribute System, Korean States and \nNortheast Asian Interstate Relations, 600-1600\u201d (Ph.D. diss., Univ. of California, Los Angeles, \n1998), 6\u201333, 115\u201320, 146\u201349.

The second argument concerns the context of this interpolation. During the first six \ndecades of Mongol rule in East Asia, the status of this imperial tradition \nwas an open question. Only after Khubilai\u2019s accession did the Mongol court seek to explicitly link its political authority to this tradition and its repertoires.20 But even before the Mongols claimed this tradition, Kory\u014f \nalready appealed to a notion of a moral empire rooted in a common \ncultural inheritance. These appeals did not target Khubilai or his prede -\ncessors per se, but rather made common cause with the agenda of their \nConfucian-minded officials by portraying Korea as a repository of its cultural and political legacies of the imperial past. For these officials, Korean submission and cooperation was likely welcome as a tangible \ndemonstration to Khubilai of the value of the imperial tradition they \nhoped he would adopt. Finally, the essay works against the grain of con-ventional understandings of Kory\u014f\u2019s surrender. It argues that the sur -\nvival of the Kory\u014f royal house and Korea as a political entity was the logical consequence of neither Mongol cooptation strategies nor a pre -\nexisting model of tributary relations. Instead, it depended on how Kory\u014f diplomacy interfaced with China\u2019s imperial tradition, manipulating and \nshaping its operation.\n19)\u2002See the Jin debate over drawing their legitimacy from the Khitan Liao or the Northern \nSong, both states they had defeated.

Thus, demon-\nstrating his loyalty to the Mongols, he convinced Khubilai to send troops to support his father.27 By 1273, Mongol forces destroyed the last rem-\nnants of the Kory\u014f military who resisted the uneasy peace.28\nWhether these events point to a successful Mongol conquest, \nachieved by coopting the Kory\u014f kingship, or a genuine royal restoration \nYi Kok), 3, Han\u2019guk munjip ch\u2019onggan \u97d3\u570b\u6587\u96c6\u53e2\u520a (hereafter HMC) (Seoul: Minjok mun-\nhwa ch\u2019ujinhoe, 1991\u2013), 118b\u2013120b, esp. 118c\u2013118d.\n25)\u2002Kory\u014f sa , 27.29b\u201330a, 1274 \u201cW\u014fnjong\u201d 15:", "doc_id": "e8aaa4c4-addd-4f96-a77d-a55e46071a6a", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "f5b1de44431336d29d8f1313288405381173fcfcab2651c1f21e1e7b78f90004", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 21083, "end": 23255}, "relationships": {"1": "00258040-b523-4142-b9eb-c8caff7e5667", "2": "646f555b-c1bf-43de-a310-77c3d7a09ddd", "3": "0eef6b1a-ff8c-47c3-8f0f-5a9eeedb89ca"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "0eef6b1a-ff8c-47c3-8f0f-5a9eeedb89ca": {"__data__": {"text": "Mongols, he convinced Khubilai to send troops to support his father.27 By 1273, Mongol forces destroyed the last rem-\nnants of the Kory\u014f military who resisted the uneasy peace.28\nWhether these events point to a successful Mongol conquest, \nachieved by coopting the Kory\u014f kingship, or a genuine royal restoration \nYi Kok), 3, Han\u2019guk munjip ch\u2019onggan \u97d3\u570b\u6587\u96c6\u53e2\u520a (hereafter HMC) (Seoul: Minjok mun-\nhwa ch\u2019ujinhoe, 1991\u2013), 118b\u2013120b, esp. 118c\u2013118d.\n25)\u2002Kory\u014f sa , 27.29b\u201330a, 1274 \u201cW\u014fnjong\u201d 15: \u5143\u5b97\u4e4b\u7232\u4e16\u5b50\u4e5f\uff0c\u6b0a\u81e3\u5c08\u6b0a\uff0c\u6063\u884c\uf967\u7fa9\uff0c\u754f\n\u4e0a\u570b\u8a0e\u7f6a\uff0c\uf967\u6a02\u5167\u9644\uff1b\u8499\u53e4\u4e4b\u5175\u9023\u5e74\u58d3\u5883\uff0c\u4e2d\u5916\u9a37\u7136\u3002\u738b\u627f\u7236\u738b\u4e4b\u547d\uff0c\u89aa\u671d\u4e0a\u570b\uff0c\n\u6467\u4f0f\u6b0a\u81e3\u8dcb\u6248\u4e4b\u5fd7\uff0c\u9042\u4f7f\u75bd\u80cc\u800c\u6b7b\u3002\u53c8\uff0c\u963f\u91cc\u5b5b\u54e5\u4ee5\u61b2\u5b97\u5ae1\u5b50\u963b\u5175\uff0c\u4e0a\u90fd\u4e16\u7687\u4ee5\u85e9\u738b\uff0c\u5728\u6881\u695a\u4e4b\u90ca\uff0c\u800c\u4e43\u80fd\u8b58\u5929\u547d\uff0c\u6c11\u5fc3\u4e4b\u53bb\u5c31\uff0c\u820d\u8fd1\u4e4b\u9060\uff0c\u4e16\u7687\u5609\u4e4b\u81f3\uff0c\u4ee5\u516c\u4e3b\u6b78\u4e8e\u738b\u5b50\u3002\u81ea\u662f\u4e16\u7d50\u8205\u7525\u4e4b\u597d\uff0c\u4f7f\u6771\u65b9\u4e4b\u6c11\uff0c\u4eab\u767e\u5e74\u6607\u5e73\u4e4b\u6a02\uff0c\u4ea6\u53ef\u5c19\u4e5f\u3002 \n26)\u2002Kingship remained weak even after the Ch\u2019oe house\u2019s demise, for power passed to other \nmilitary leaders.

With the \u201cedicts of Emperor Shizu [i.e., Khubilai] as a \nbasis,\u201d Kory\u014f\u2019s status as an exceptional space was guaranteed by past imperial sanction. To rescind this status would be to undermine ances -\ntral authority.33 As Korean historian Yi Ikchu has argued, invoking the \u201clegacies of  Emperor Shizu\u201d (Sejo kuje \n\u4e16\u7956\u820a\u5236 ), provided the institu-\ntional basis for Kory\u014f\u2019s political autonomy within the Mongol-Yuan em-\npire.34 Through them, later Mongol policies could thus be contested, the \nKory\u014f royal family protected, and Kory\u014f\u2019s autonomy defended.\nBut what sort of accomplishment is an act of surrender? An argu-\nment from a position of weakness, the rhetorical effectiveness of  this \ncornerstone of Kory\u014f diplomacy derived from a familiar political trope in the construction of imperial legitimacy. According to the Book of Doc-\numents, the sage ruler Shun brought his enemies to submission, not \nthrough the force of arms, but by \u201cpropagating civil virtue,\u201d and attend-\ning to the rites of state.35 The voluntary submission of foreigners and barbarians therefore demonstrated a ruler\u2019s resemblance to sage rulers \nof yore.

It is still of course possible that the \naccount was retrofitted to cohere with the narratives used in Kory\u014f di-\nplomacy. A limited source base precludes a firm assessment of how the \nKory\u014f History\u2019s narrative relate to the events of 1259, but situating the \nKory\u014f surrender in the political and intellectual context of Khubilai\u2019s rise, especially the rhetorical and symbolic transformation of the Mon-\ngol empire in East Asia into the Great Yuan, leads to a plausible inter -\npretation.40 For decades, Khubilai\u2019s Chinese advisers sought to recast \ntheir Mongol overlords as emperors within a native imperial tradition, complete with the rhetorical, ritual, and bureaucratic trappings of Con-\nfucian government. W\u014fnjong\u2019s arrival could have been useful for dem-\nonstrating the validity of their ideas and programs, serving as much the political and ideological needs of these Confucian-minded officials as it \ndid Khubilai himself.\nAlthough defeated by Khubilai on the battlefield, his younger brother \nArigh B\u00f6ke was arguably the more legitimate contender. Like all preced-ing Great Khans, Arigh B\u00f6ke was selected through a khuriltai, the con-\ngress of princes.41 Khubilai, denied traditional Mongol modes of political \nsanction, was motivated to construct his authority in alternative ways.

Adoption of particular institutions and practices should not be \nconflated with cultural and ethnic transformation. This cultural essentialism misrepresents how political regimes in East Asia, whose elites hailed from a variety of ethnic and cultural backgrounds, drew from the Chinese imperial repertoire in flexible ways. In fact, divesting the Chinese political and intellectual tradition of its ethnocentric elements was key for its \nadaptation by the Jurchens, Mongols, and Koreans, among others.

The catch was that \nthese models provided not only templates for military glory, but also a \nwhole cultural and political program.58 By linking territorial ambition with the political traditions they espoused, Hao Jing and his colleagues \nslipped in their own priorities through a rhetorical Trojan Horse.\nThe Mongol ruler\u2019s realization of his imperial destiny through the \ncomparison to Tang Taizong in the Kory\u014f History converges with this \nrhetorical strategy. Since Khubilai\u2019s willingness to identify with his Con-fucian advisers\u2019 political tradition was key, the Korean surrender, as evi-\ndence of Khubilai\u2019s supercession of Tang Taizong, potentially showcased the efficacy of the political program they offered their patron. Although \nno surviving texts from Chinese writers at the time indicate that the \nKory\u014f surrender was employed explicitly in this manner, traces of how it suited the ideological program of Khubilai\u2019s Confucian officials do ap -\npear in the Yuan History. Shortly after W\u014fnjong\u2019s surrender, his father \nKing Kojong \n\u9ad8\u5b97  (r. 1213-1259) died. Khubilai repatriated W\u014fnjong with \nan armed escort, supporting his claims to the throne of Kory\u014f. Accord-\ning to the Yuan History, these policies followed the proposal of one of \nhis advisers, Zhao Liangbi \u8d99\u826f\u5f3c  (1217-1286):\nKory\u014f is said to be a small country by the sea\u2019s edge and cut off by mountains, but \nOur Country has warred with it for twenty-odd years and it still has not submitted \nas vassals. A few years ago, their Crown Prince Ch\u014fn [i.e., W\u014fnjong] came to court \nwhen the Imperial Entourage was campaigning west. He has lingered in our coun-try for two years now. We have provisioned him meagerly. There is nothing that \nwould bind his heart [to us]. Once he leaves for home [to Kory\u014f], he will not return \nto us again. It would be better to increase the provisions for his residence and treat \nhim according to the rites befitting a vassal ruler. Now, when he hears that his fa-\nther has died, we can surely establish Ch\u014fn as king and escort him back to his country.

This strategy, second-ed by the influential Uyghur Confucian official Lian Xixian \n\u5ec9\u5e0c\u61b2  (1231-\n1280), also aligned with long-standing Mongol practices of cooptation \nby exploiting the opportunity to accommodate indigenous forms of au-\nthority for the empire\u2019s benefit.61\nThe Mongols sought to reorient the loyalties and aspirations of local \nelites, because they recognized military prowess did not always readily convert into political control.62 Khubilai\u2019s predecessors, for instance, ef-fectively decapitated the Jurchen Jin by eliminating the imperial family, but retained the service of regional military leaders.63 At the outset of \n60)\u2002The Secret History of the Mongols only mentions the Korean wars in passing.

As Igor de Rachewiltz and others have argued, earlier conquests depended on the piecemeal surrender and collaboration of former foes. By the mid-thir-teenth century, Mongol forces were no longer strictly speaking a band of nomadic cavalry, but a coalition of different groups, each providing distinct contributions to the conquest. They included the mangonel engineers of Central Asia who helped take Xiangyang, civil administrators of the old Jurchen Jin, and practitioners of esoteric ritual among the Lamas of Tangut Xi-Xia and Tibet.

The Kory\u014f king was not the only candidate for cooptation. The impostor heir apparent, Prince \nY\u014fngny\u014fng, who had become a bona fide member of the Mongol nobil-\nity, was a viable alternative.67 Indeed, the Mongols need not have turned \nto the Kory\u014f royal family at all; neither was the continued existence of \nKory\u014f as a political entity inevitable. There were also prominent Kory\u014f \ndefectors such as Hong Pogw\u014fn \n\u6d2a\u798f\u6e90  (1206-1258) and, later, his son \nHong Chagu \u6d2a\u8336\u4e18  (1244-1291).68 Even as Khubilai supported W\u014fnjong\u2019s \nclaim to the throne, first in 1260 and again when he restored him to pow -\ner after the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat of 1269, Kory\u014f\u2019s annexation remained a possibili-\nty.

He nominally remained Dali\u2019s ruler, though his domain was \nplaced under Mongol administration.74\nThe two accounts of the Dali conquest are contradictory in their por -\ntrayal of Khubilai\u2019s temperament but are consistent in their service of a \nhistoriographical trope, where a virtuous official, through moral sua-\nsion, could influence the behavior of his ruler. Pared of its moral va-\nlence, this advice for Dali essentially anticipates the strategy Zhao Liangbi and Zhao Bi advocated for managing Kory\u014f. Although the two \nZhaos emphasized resource efficiency rather than the minimization of \nbloodshed, as was the case with Zhang and Yao, they all sought a negoti-ated surrender, a diplomatic conclusion to the war. Of course, the prom-\nise of leniency and the cooptation of local elites were long part of the \nMongol repertoire of conquest. The hackneyed opposition between wise official and wayward ruler in these accounts, which Morris Rossabi sees to be a product of \u201cChinese myth-making,\u201d habitually overestimate \nthe influence of these advisers.75 But even if Khubilai did not necessar -\nily prosecute these wars in light of received advice, their successes were \nnonetheless presented, both to posterity and to contemporaries in terms \nof the ideological rationales of his advisers.\nAs was the case for the Kory\u014f History\u2019s version of events, key to the \nYuan History accounts was Khubilai\u2019s thinking that his conquests fol-\nlowed the footsteps of past imperial exemplars. At least rhetorically, the \nvoluntary surrender of the Kory\u014f royal house, along with the conquest of Dali, was used to burnish his image as a sage ruler. In 1266, Khubilai \ndispatched envoys bearing a state letter that hoped to use the pacifica-\ntion of Kory\u014f to impress Japan:\nWhen I first acceded to the throne, I commanded my troops to withdraw from \nKory\u014f, because its innocent people had long suffered the ravages of war. I restored \nto them their territory and repatriated captives, both aged and young.

Some of these embassies, having \nfailed to convince rival rulers to submit, were received as provocations.

Common to their rhetorical strategy is an insistence that adherence to past imperial models could affect voluntary submis -\nsion of other rulers and peoples. Situating Mongol rule within a local imperial idiom also transformed Khubilai from a foreign interloper into a dynastic founder, a veritable heir to the sage kings of yore. The useful-\nness of the Kory\u014f\u2019s submission for Hao and his colleagues would have \nbeen less to legitimize Khubilai\u2019s rule or rationalize his conquest of the south, than to demonstrate in tangible terms the effectiveness of the \npolitical program they had advocated. It was to convince Khubilai of the \nmerits of an imperial tradition and a form of government where men like them, masters of Confucian learning and Chinese letters, would sit near the apex. Ironically, it was the same tradition that Khubilai\u2019s prede -\ncessors had effectively cut off when they destroyed the Jin. As will be discussed in the next section, the Kory\u014f court hinged its diplomatic rhetoric on making common cause with this project of imperial revival.\nKory\u014f Diplomatic Letters: Recovering the Empire and Making \nEmperors\nThe appeal to the imperial past was never simply about the legitimation \nof rulership.

Korean diplomats, in their efforts to mitigate the devas -\ntation of the Mongol invasions, had long attempted to do the same. A \nsimilar rhetorical strategy could be gleaned from Kory\u014f diplomatic mis -\nsives from the era. Resonances between Kory\u014f narratives of surrender \nand the policies advanced by Khubilai\u2019s Confucian officials, then, were \nfar from coincidental. They both were part of an unfolding of a decades-\nlong project of co-construction, where subjugated groups attempted to impose their own notions of political order upon their erstwhile over -\nlords.\nKory\u014f had in fact cast Mongol rulers as Confucian emperors long be -\nfore Khubilai\u2019s accession. In the wake of renewed Mongol aggression after 1235, the Kory\u014f court dispatched envoys bearing missives to the \nMongols in 1238 and 1239. The Kory\u014f envoy from 1238 bore a diplomatic \nmemorial (biaojian / p\u2019yoj\u014fn \n\u8868\u7b8b ) recognizing \u00d6g\u00f6dei Khan as an em-\nperor in the Confucian mode. Written on behalf of the Kory\u014f ruler by his \nrenowned minister Yi Kyubo \u674e\u594e\u5831  (1168-1241), this document followed \nthe rhetorical conventions and stylistic format of earlier memorials written to the Jin court. As such, it signaled to the Mongols that Kory\u014f \nwas ready to accord to them whatever prerogatives their predecessors once enjoyed, with the expectation that the Mongols too inhabit the \nimperial roles modeled for them by the sages of yore.87 This message, \n85)\u2002Hao Jing, \u201cBan shi yi\u201d \u73ed\u5e2b\u8b70,  Lingchuan ji, 32.41a: \u82e5\u5929\u8207\u6211\uff0c\u4e0d\u5fc5\u6bba\u4eba\uff0c\u82e5\u5929\u5f17 \n\u8207\uff0c\u6bba\u4eba\u4f55\u76ca ?

As part of \nthis rhetorical strategy, they also cast their Mongol overlords as putative heirs of that same imperial tradition. These epistles also served Kory\u014f\u2019s \nimmediate interests, opening up a space of negotiation with officials \nwho could intercede on Kory\u014f\u2019s behalf, when its fate was still uncertain.119\nWhat few sources survive prevent assessing the effectiveness of Kory\u014f \ndiplomacy relative to other factors. Certainly, Mongol strategic calcula-\ntions and other contingencies (many of which are unknowable) played \nimportant roles. Nonetheless, Korean appeals still resonated with the notions of cultural recovery and imperial restoration, which feature \nprominently in the writings of Chinese literati of this period. While \nKory\u014f itself is mentioned only occasionally in their texts, when it does, it appears in specific terms: as a civilized country where the very institu-\ntions they hoped to revive still lived on.

They soon dis -\npensed with interpreters altogether and turned to brush-talk, which \nallowed them to delve into more exact matters of political legitimacy and Korea\u2019s history. Khubilai\u2019s officials were reassured that Kory\u014f no \nlonger used the Song imperial calendar. They learned the Wang rulers of \nKory\u014f were descendants of a Tang imperial prince who sought refuge in Korea (an apocryphal founding myth, undoubtedly embellished by the \nking\u2019s attendants).122 Yao Shu also hoped that the Koreans were in pos -\nsession of classical texts long lost in China. Though disappointed that \nKorean books were really \u201cno different from that of the Central Plains,\u201d \nhe did learn of Kory\u014f\u2019s official examination system, which recruited civ -\nil officials through tests in composition and classical exegesis.123\nThese examinations must have piqued Yao\u2019s interest partly because \ntheir reinstitution had been a major policy priority for him and his col-leagues. Since the Mongol conquest of the Jin in 1234, no such examina-\ntions had taken place in northern China for decades, and they would be discontinued after the fall of the Song in the south. During this time, \nhowever, the Kory\u014f continued to hold examinations. Zhao Liangbi, for \ninstance, once discussed the merits of the civil service examination with Khubilai. The emperor lauded the Kory\u014f for \u201cmastering the Clas -\nsics and the Books, and the way of Confucius and Mencius\u201d and derided the northern Chinese for only attending to belles-lettres. Zhao retorted \nthat this deficiency was because there was no examination system in \nChina, implying that if the emperor wanted to cultivate men of learning, \n120)\u2002Franke, \u201cWang Y\u00fcn,\u201d 153\u201393.\n121)\u2002Wang Yun, Zhongtang shiji, in Qiujian ji, 82.3b\u20134a.122)\u2002For myth, see Breuker, Establishing a Pluralist Society in Medieval Korea, 120\u201321.123)\u2002Wang Yun, Zhongtang shiji, in Qiujian ji, 82.4a\u2013b.\n 371 The Korean Surrender of 1259 and the Imperial Tradition\nT\u2019oung Pao 104 (2018) 338-383he should promote the knowledge he desired, as Kory\u014f had done.124 \nSuch entreaties were unsuccessful; the Mongols only restored the ex -\naminations in 1313, after Yao Shu\u2019s nephew Yao Sui \u59da\u71e7  (1239-1314) man-\naged to convince the Yuan emperor Ayurbarwada Buyantu Khan, \nRenzong \u5143\u4ec1\u5b97  (1285-1320; r. 1311-1320), of their merits.125\nKhubilai\u2019s officials, many former servants of the Jin, saw in Kory\u014f a \nversion of a Confucian political and cultural order they were fighting to", "doc_id": "0b1ca18e-63c2-4ebe-89b5-06076b2f0c38", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "ca7639c8b93a602b1441d345696078404a0072c2ff9f948702bd4b58dfa50e84", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 109414, "end": 112584}, "relationships": {"1": "00258040-b523-4142-b9eb-c8caff7e5667", "2": "ee11824a-726d-45e3-a60f-b81c2a235da5", "3": "21b2ce38-aba1-443e-95d5-c89addbedf3a"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "21b2ce38-aba1-443e-95d5-c89addbedf3a": {"__data__": {"text": "The Korean Surrender of 1259 and the Imperial Tradition\nT\u2019oung Pao 104 (2018) 338-383he should promote the knowledge he desired, as Kory\u014f had done.124 \nSuch entreaties were unsuccessful; the Mongols only restored the ex -\naminations in 1313, after Yao Shu\u2019s nephew Yao Sui \u59da\u71e7  (1239-1314) man-\naged to convince the Yuan emperor Ayurbarwada Buyantu Khan, \nRenzong \u5143\u4ec1\u5b97  (1285-1320; r. 1311-1320), of their merits.125\nKhubilai\u2019s officials, many former servants of the Jin, saw in Kory\u014f a \nversion of a Confucian political and cultural order they were fighting to \nrestore.

Surviving records from the decades around Khubilai\u2019s \naccession (roughly 1250s to 1270s) exhibit a strong resonance between \nKory\u014f diplomatic strategy and the political rhetoric of Khubilai\u2019s Chi-nese and Confucian advisers.

According to the Kory\u014f sa, the official Korean \ndynastic history, Khubilai saw the timely Korean capitulation as demonstrating his superiority over the Tang emperor Taizong, who had failed to subjugate Korea by force. Although the account certainly embellished certain details, notably the vol-untary nature of the surrender, this paper argues that it nonetheless captures an important dynamic between Korean diplomatic strategy and the political and ide -\nological goals of Khubilai and his advisers. The Kory\u014f court, hoping to ensure the kingship\u2019s institutional survival, portrayed Korea as representing the cultural and political legacies of the imperial past to make common cause with Khubilai\u2019s offi-cials who sought to recast the Mongol empire in the image of China\u2019s past imperial dynasties. The convergence of Korean diplomatic missives, accounts in Chinese and Korean historiography, and writings by Khubilai\u2019s closest Chinese advisers on the themes of imperial restoration and cultural revival result in part from these interactions.

First assembled in 1778,\nit eventually comprised over four million characters with its last addendum in1881.\n2\nThe organization of the Tongmun hwigo conveniences the modern researcher in\nseveral ways. Its systematic organization provides welcome respite to a lonescholar otherwise overwhelmed by the sheer volume of Chos \u014fn\u2019s diplomatic re-\ncords. It divides diplomacy into discrete areas \u2014tribute missions, illegal border\ncrossings, investiture, shipwrecks, and calendrical perturbations such as eclipses,so central to imperial claims of cosmic sovereignty \u2014to give a few examples. Each\narea is then contained under its own subheading, where relevant cases are then\narranged chronologically.\n3In lieu of original documents, every entry stands in\nfor the curated archival \ufb01le, ready-made for a historian \u2019s case study.4\nIt is easy to forget, however, that the Tongmun hwigo was not produced for the\nbene\ufb01t of later historians.

What therefore needs to be placed into proper per-\nspective is how compilations such as Tongmun hwigo worked within the apparatus\nof the Chos \u014fn state.\n5To do so, this discussion treats Chos \u014fn\u2019s diplomatic compi-\nlations in terms of the archival processes responding to the demands and objec-\ntives of Chos \u014fn\u2019s diplomacy with imperial China.\nThe term archive warrants discussion. According to the Canadian archival\nscholar Terry Cook, it has at least two common, but divergent uses. In the singu-\nlar, an archive works as a \u201cmetaphorical symbol \u201dfor the collective memory of a\ncommunity. The Chos \u014fn court \u2019s diplomatic records thus archive a memory of Ko-\nrea\u2019s past relations. In the Foucaldian sense, it also instantiates a system of knowl-\nedge by reproducing the \u201cmatrices that contain the dominant discourses of [its]\nculture. \u201dBut in the plural, \u201carchives \u201dalso refer to brick-and-mortar repositories\nof\u201coriginal \u201dmaterials.6Their coherence derives from what modern archival sci-\nence calls the principle of \u201cprovenance. \u201dTo qualify as archives, their collections\nmust be \u201corganic entit[ies] \u201demerging naturally from the processes of their crea-\ntion and \u201cde\ufb01ned by the sphere of life from which they originate. \u201d7Certainly,\nthere are libraries and institutions in South Korea, such as the Kyujanggak and\nJangseogak Archives, that store not only Chos \u014fn period diplomatic compilations,\nbut also a wide range of state records in general. Through their curation efforts256 Sixiang Wang\nDownloaded from https://read.dukeupress.edu/journal-of-korean-studies/article-pdf/24/2/255/744978/255wang.pdf\nby UNIV CA LOS ANGELES SERIALS user\non 08 March 2020\na wide range of transcriptions, reprints, and digital reproductions have become\navailable for public learning.8But as is the case for the Tongmun hwigo ,t h e s e\nstate records have survived primarily in the form of compilations, and not originaldocuments.

Itself a product of relatively recent provenance, its valorization is con-\nnected to the historiographical positivism of Leopold von Ranke. It proceeds from\na conceit that the paper trail of government machinery, stored in state archives, cancapture history as it \u201creally was \u201dbetter than other materials. While revolutionary\nfor its time, the archive can only be a \u201cneutral and unproblematic reservoi[r] of\nhistorical fact \u201dif archivists are imagined as \u201cimpartial guardian[s] of the surviving\ntraces of the past, \u201dcontent to be \u201csimply the obedient and silent handmaiden of\nthe historian. \u201d\n10Whether such neutrality is attainable (or desirable) is up to debate,\nbut this fantasy, combined with the ideal of \u201c[keeping] all records permanently\nready for almost instantaneous access, \u201dre\ufb02ects far more the historian \u2019s desire\nfor a \u201cnonproblematic, pure ...a r c h i v e \u201dof original, untainted evidence, than\nhow actual archival records were curated and used. Indeed, given the politicalstakes of record-keeping and the prevalence of \u201ccounter-archival activities \u201dsuch\nas purgation, destruction, and recycling, the \u201cinvisible caretaker \u201dbecomes ever\nmore dif \ufb01cult to imagine.\n11\nThe speci \ufb01c curation practices of these materials in modern South Korea are\nbeyond the scope of this essay. But awareness that an \u201carchive \u201dis not a static ob-\nject but a result of active practices reminds us that, whether or not documents areof original provenance, our present experience of any archive is already mediated\nby the record-keeping practices that informed their creation. To speak of compi-\nlations such as the Tongmun hwigo in terms of archives, then, is less to \ufb01x their\nontological status than to bring attention to the rationales and practices of record-\nkeeping at the Chos \u014fn court. A Chos \u014fno f\ufb01cial would never have imagined the\nrecords he produced would one day be privy to the public eye, a visibility incon-ceivable before the democratization of archival access in the nineteenth cen-\ntury that made Ranke \u2019s historical positivism possible in the \ufb01rst place.\n12The\nidea, shared in common by modern state-funded repositories, that national mem-ory is best preserved through widespread accessibility of state records to the\nscholarly community and the general public, would have been an alien notion\nto the Chos \u014fn court agencies who compiled them.

It discusses how the Chos \u014fn dip-\nlomatic archive came into being through different stages of record processing. It\nbegins with the textual objects the Tongmun hwigo collects: the diplomatic doc-\numents themselves and their place in diplomatic practice. It then moves on to the\nt\u016dngnok\u8b04\u9304produced in the course of administering diplomatic activity. Liter-\nally a \u201ccopied record \u201dor\u201crecorded note, \u201dthe t\u016dngnok straddles the conventional\nboundary between a registry and an archive, in which the former holds documents\nunder regular use and the latter for preservation.14Finally, it will address the emer-\ngence of the Tongmun hwigo as a compilation in light of how its epistemic strat-\negies compare with those of other institutional reference books for diplomatic\npractice, in particular the T\u2019ongmun \u2019gwan chi \u901a\u6587\u9928\u5fd7(Compendium of the In-\nterpreters \u2019Bureau ).\nIf we consider the diplomatic archive even more broadly, we may also include a\nwide array of other materials: language textbooks,15ritual guides, poetry anthol-\nogies,16and travelogues and diaries produced by Korean envoys and their entou-\nrage.17Needless to say, a full accounting of all these materials would be impos-\nsible to achieve in the space of one paper. Our goals here are necessarily more\nmodest \u2014to disentangle several strands from a complex tapestry, rather than ex-\nplain its totality.\nWHAT IS A CHOS \u014eN DIPLOMATIC DOCUMENT?\nThe bulk of the Tongmun hwigo are transcriptions of diplomatic documents. But\nwhat exactly do we mean by a \u201cdiplomatic \u201ddocument? The usual overarching\nhistoriographical term in Korean is oegyo muns \u014f,\u201cdocuments for foreign rela-\ntions, \u201da special subset of komuns \u014f,\u201cold documents, \u201da broad category that covers\nlegal contracts, deeds, wills, royal and other of \ufb01cial decrees, slave status docu-\nments, and judicial rulings.18What all oegyo muns \u014fhave in common with ko-\nmuns\u014f, and what distinguishes both from other documents, such as private letters\nor books, is precisely their inclusion of certain \u201cdiplomatic \u201dfeatures (in the orig-\ninal sense of the word diploma ) to ensure authenticity and of \ufb01cial status: seal im-\nprints, formal consistency, signatures, and administrative jargon.\nBut distinctive about oegyo muns \u014ffrom the Chos \u014fn period, especially those\nexchanged with imperial China, is the degree to which they participate in a cer-\nemonial program as a ritual object. Arguably all diplomatic communiqu\u00e9s, in anyperiod \u2014a diplomatic cable, a joint declaration, a treaty, or perhaps even a tweet \u2014\nobey certain conventions and regulations constraining their format and language\nand may be regarded as \u201critual \u201dobjects, insofar as they are embedded with rou-\ntines and processes that endow them with meaning beyond the wording of the\ntexts they contain.

For in-\nstance, when a Ming emperor acknowledged the legitimacy of a new Korean ruler,it was not enough that a message be delivered \u2014for the act of imperial investiture\nto work, this document must be received in a ceremonial context agreed upon by\nall participants. Indeed, much of Chos \u014fn\u2019s diplomatic governance was devoted to\nmanaging the receipt and delivery of such documents. If the numerous contesta-\ntions between imperial envoys and the Korean hosts concerning the protocols and\nceremonies of receiving imperial edicts are any indication, rituals of diplomaticcontact endow certain documents with an ontological status beyond what its\ntext is communicating. One recurring issue in these contestations was whether\nthe Chos \u014fn court owed ceremonial deference to the imperial envoy because of\nhis status as a messenger from the emperor or because he was the bearer of the\nsacred object \u2014the imperial document.\n19\nNot all diplomatic documents necessarily have the same ritual status or perfor-\nmative quality. As illustrated in table 1, diplomatic interaction entailed the use of a\nwide variety of documentary forms. A number of variables determine what kind\nof document should be issued and for what purpose. The identities of the senderand receiver, their hierarchical relationship, as well as the context and message,\ndetermine the type of document issued. The documents vary in style \u2014whether\nthe ornate parallel prose ( py\u014fnmun\n\u99e2\u6587) appropriate for ceremonial contexts\nor the \u201clayered quotation \u201dstyle of bureaucratic prose ( imun\u540f\u6587).20The nomen-\nclature is therefore highly speci \ufb01c; knowing what to call the document usually\nsuf\ufb01ces for ascertaining the above variables.

The \ufb01rst patent of\ninvestiture ( komy\u014fng) veri \ufb01es S\u014fngjong as the Korean king. Though S \u014fngjong\nwas already de facto king at the time, the patent of investiture therefore carriesa performative function of establishing it as diplomatic fact. Translating a local\npolitical reality into an imperial reality was also the function of the second patent\nof investiture. Addressed to King S \u014fngjong \u2019s consort, it invested her as Queen\nConsort and charged her with protecting the family line and serving as a moral\nmodel for the inner quarters. The two edicts ( ch\u2019iks\u014f) accompanying the investi-\nture served yet different functions. The \ufb01rst edict enumerates the gifts bestowed\nupon the Korean king to congratulate his accession. The second edict alone concerns\n\u201cnon-ritual \u201dmatters of diplomatic policy (if such a rough distinction between rit-\nual and policy can be made). At the time Chos \u014fn court was engaged in hostilities\nwith the Jurchens of Jianzhou, and this document spoke to the imperial effort in\nmediating between Chos \u014fn and Jianzhou, with a warning that though the Jurchens\nagreed to cease hostilities, the king should remain circumspect.\n24\nIn the diplomatic ceremonies, these documents, issued by the emperor, were\nthemselves the subject of fanfare.

They ex-\npressed the sentiments of an embodied sovereignty: kingship personi \ufb01ed as an\nincarnation of a state and its people.

Among their ranks included such venerable \ufb01gures such as the\nKory\u014fstatesmen Yi Kyubo \u674e\u594e\u5831(1168 \u20131241) and Yi Chehy \u014fn\u674e\u9f4a\u8ce2(1297 \u2013\n1367), the famous Kory \u014fliterati Yi Kok \u674e\u6996(1298 \u20131351) and his son Yi Saek\n\u674e\u7a61(1328 \u201396), and the Chos \u014fn dyansty \u2019s founding \ufb01gures, Ch \u014fng Toj \u014fn\u912d\u9053\u50b3\n(1342 \u201398) and Kw \u014fnK\u016dn\u6b0a\u8fd1(1352 \u20131409).36Later compilers of literary collec-\ntions of individual authors ( munjip\u6587\u96c6), which often postdate the composition of\nthese documents by centuries, likely bene \ufb01ted from these attributions.37\nAny one diplomatic memorial passed through many hands. It underwent a re-\nview and proofreading process before a \ufb01nal version was approved for delivery.38\nBut wordsmithing was only one step in a longer chain of production.

The bulk of original Korean doc-uments that survive to this day from this collection are memorials to the Qing\ncourt; the rate of survival is much lower for the Ming.\n45Though unlikely to ex-\nplain all the loss, a contributing factor may have been the value late Ming literatiplaced on Korean memorial paper. The renowned Ming painter and calligrapher\nDong Qichang\n\u8463\u5176\u660c(1555 \u20131636), who at the apex of his career served as Ming\nMinister of Rites, evidently availed himself of Korean documents stored in theimperial archives. After washing off the ink bearing these royal missives, he re-\npurposed the paper for his own artwork. The red cinnabar-based oils used for seal\nimprints, however, were not water soluble. For this reason, several of Dong Qi-chang \u2019s landscape paintings still bear the mark of the Chos \u014fn royal seal, and at\ntimes even the text of the original Korean diplomatic document is faintly visible\non the paper (see \ufb01g. 1).\n46\nUltimately, it is still Chos \u014fn compilations that provide us with the most com-\nprehensive record of their contents. Their survival owes to several convergent\npressures. The \ufb01rst is how past writing becomes a guide for future compositions.\nEarly Chos \u014fn period memorial writers drew from these earlier sources as models\nfor their compositions, but in the process, they also left behind their own literary\nexamples for later generations. To create these models was likely the intent of theTongmuns \u014fn. While some diplomatic documents are quoted or paraphrased in\nof\ufb01cial histories such as the Kory\u014fsa\n\u9ad8\u9e97\u53f2(The Kory \u014fHistory ) or the Kory\u014fsa\nch\u014fryo\u9ad8\u9e97\u53f2\u7bc0\u8981(Abbreviated Summary of Kory \u014f\u2019s History ), they appear as\nillustrative pieces of a court chronicle, preserved less for their textual or literary\nvalue than for the political history they documented.

Like the Venetian Cancelleria Secreta , which reveals\n\u201cmore about the rhetoric of the self-styled Serene Republic, \u201dthan about political\nrealities, so too does the Chos \u014fn diplomatic record reveal how much diplomacy\nwas about reconciling Korean interests with imperial ambitions and pieties withits ideology. This reconciliation entailed reproducing and sustaining templates of\nabstraction \u2014that is, a way to address political upheaval, frontier incidents, con-\ntroversies of succession, and matters of grievance that would be conceptuallyand rhetorically acceptable to the sovereign claims of the imperial court, but\nstill assert the prerogatives of the Chos \u014fn state as a self-governing Confucian\nmonarchy.\n48\nIntercourse with imperial China relied on the activation of past precedents,\nwhether found in classical models, protocols of ritual, past imperial edicts, or\nshared political commitments.

For one, we now have access to Ming\nand Qing records stored in Beijing that were once inaccessible to the Chos \u014fn\ncourt. But even many records located in Korea were off-limits to contemporaries.\nThe Chos \u014fnVeritable Records is a case in point. Today, as a full-text, online\nsearchable database, it is an eminently accessible source, thanks in part to the cu-\nration efforts of South Korea \u2019s National Institute of Korean History (Kuksa P \u2019y\u014fn-\nch\u2019an Wiw \u014fnhoe). It is invaluable for its coverage of early Chos \u014fn-Ming relations,\nfor which textual records are relatively sparse. But the conditions of access during\nthe Chos \u014fn period could not be more different. Compiled by committee after the\ndeath of each king, these chronicles of the Chos \u014fn dynasty were not for contem-\nporary eyes. Once completed, the draft versions of the Veritable Records were\nwashed away and burned as part of a mourning ritual for the deceased king.\nThis practice likely doubled as a precaution against their dissemination, for the\ufb01nal copies were sent away to be locked in repositories. Closely guarded, access\neven to the court was granted only in rare instances.\n49\nAs Graeme Reynolds discusses in his contribution to this issue, these precau-\ntions did not prevent the tampering of the Veritable Records . Indeed, investment in\nhistory as both a source for moral guidance and authoritative precedent only raised\nthe political stakes of controlling its narrative.50How veritable these chronicles\nare is therefore subject to historiographical debate, but their role in everyday\nadministration during the Chos \u014fn was limited in scope. Produced for long term\n\u201carchival \u201dsafekeeping, they were virtually inaccessible for administrative refer-\nence; they were not consulted as authorities of \ufb01rst resort by the royal court and\nits agencies. Government functionaries relied instead on the t \u016dngnok, \u201crecorded\nnotes, \u201dhandwritten ledgers that documented the activities of their respective insti-\ntutions.51\nInstead of original documentary material or historical chronicles, the main\nadministrative references for Chos \u014fn agencies were t \u016dngnok. To give an example\nin the domain of foreign relations, in 1725 the newly crowned King Y \u014fngjo\n(r. 1724 \u201376) learned that twenty-six men from the Qing had been shipwrecked\nin Cheju.

A chancery of \ufb01ce that handled, created, and stored diplomatic\nmissives, it was created in 1411 to replace legacy Kory \u014forgans, as part of a gen-\neral reform of record-keeping at the Chos \u014fn state. A post in the chancery was a\nprestigious assignment, reserved usually for most talented (and well-connected)\npassers of the munkwa civil service examinations.56At\ufb01rst, it kept only original\nversions of documents, but in 1421, to guard against \u201cthe calamity of water and\n\ufb01re,\u201dit began to make copies ( t\u016dngsa\u8b04\u5beb) of these correspondences to be stored\nin other repositories.57According to the procedures documented in the Chos \u014fn\ngovernment \u2019sGreat Code of Administration (Ky\u014fngguk taej \u014fn\u7d93\u570b\u5927\u5178), the sec-\nretary of a returning envoy mission was also to submit their written reports of their\nobservations to the chancery for inclusion in its recorded notes.58\nT\u016dngnok took the form of bound manuscripts. Collation, binding, and the pres-\nence of a book cover guarded to some degree against damage and loss.

It was intended as an authoritative\nreference, a purpose re \ufb02ected in its novel organizational scheme. The Tongmun\nhwigo assembled the relevant documents according to policy area.

These omissions be-\ncome the norm for documents related to the \u201croutine \u201dtriannual diplomatic mis-\nsions, namely those dispatched for the winter solstice ( tongji ), the imperial birth-\nday ( s\u014fngj\u014fl), and the new year \u2019s congratulations ( haj\u014fng).

When the text of missives are preserved,\nthey concern embassies dealing with a \u201cnonroutine \u201dissue, necessitating an ex-\nchange of documents beyond the usual presentation of diplomatic memorials.86\nThe use of templates for formulaic documents drew from conventions long es-\ntablished in earlier compilations. Both the early Chos \u014fnKosa ch \u2019waryo and the\nT\u2019ongmun \u2019gwan chi featured templates for diplomatic documents. Though they,\nlike the Tongmun hwigo , too covered diplomatic practice, these three compilations\nre\ufb02ected rather different epistemic impulses towards the documentation of dip-\nlomatic activity. The Kosa ch \u2019waryo conceived it as one of many branches of\nknowledge that fell under its purview. Besides diplomatic matters and a synopsis\nof Chos \u014fn institutions,87it also contained, for instance, conversion formulas for\nweights and measures and references for penal law and slavery regulations,88as\nwell as remedies for common maladies and laundry techniques.89Rather than a\nstatecraft manual adopting the gaze of a court of \ufb01cial, it occupied the vantage\nof a generic Chos \u014fn elite, who \u201cin the course of his life will deal with thousands\nof different matters in every move \u201dfor in \u201cmatters of public private, there are a\nrange of matters to be understood by the highest of \ufb01cial to the lowliest function-\nary, and even a gentleman who lives in leisure. \u201d90\nTheT\u2019ongmun \u2019gwan chi , in contrast, adopted a different epistemic relationship\ntoward diplomatic practice.

Its compiler, Kim Ky \u014fngnam, thus defended the value\nand urgency of the interpreter and his expertise, even as he acknowledged thelow status of its person:\n[I have undertaken this effort] because I know humbly that interpreters are indispens-\nable to the state. Although their person is insigni \ufb01cant, their duties are important. In\nserving the Great State and communicating with neighbors, these men have theirWay; when it comes to exercising it, their tools are regulations, protocols, and tem-plates. If we do not record these matters for preservation, from where can models besought?\n92\nIn defending their craft, its compilers employed a different trope of knowledge:\none of creating legibility. The urgency was not the loss of knowledge per se,\nfor the \u201csix hundred odd professional interpreters \u201dwho staffed the three-hundred-\nyear-old bureau had \u201crelied on mouth and ear, transmitting information to one an-\nother. \u201dTheir expertise was tacit; the problem was \u201cno one has written down its\naffairs in words, \u201dand without a \u201csystem, \u201dthere was no way to \u201cverify \u201ddifferent\nrules and regulations.93The compilation addressed these problems by transferring\ntacit institutional knowledge into a body of explicit and systematized knowledge\ncommon between those who staffed the organization and those who oversaw it.This move, implicit by its adoption of the nomenclature, organization, and con-\nventions of a gazetteer ( chi\n\u5fd7), made the operations of the agency legible for one\nwho sought a top-down perspective.94Its greatest bene \ufb01ciaries were unlikely to be\nthe interpreters who staffed the agency, but instead the high-ranking of \ufb01cials who\ndrew on its services during the embassies it led and the civil bureaucrats assigned\nto the agency \u2019s administration.\nThough the contents of the T\u2019ongmun \u2019gwan chi overlapped with the Tongmun\nhwigo , their purposes were distinct. They both worked towards centralizing infor-\nmation to provide holistic legibility, but if the T\u2019ongmun \u2019gwan chi aided in the\nlegibility of a state agency, the Tongmun hwigo was about the legibility of diplo-\nmacy as a practice oriented around established precedents.

If we recognize that the epistemic\nburdens they took on went far beyond the mere question of storage and retrieval,\nit becomes inadequate to view them solely as documentation for Chos \u014fn\u2019s foreign\nrelations. Instead, a different kind of analytical gaze is necessary, and with it\ncomes a different kind of historiographical promise. When compilations such as\ntheTongmun hwigo are placed back into their institutional context and viewed\nalongside their predecessors, such as the various t \u016dngnok with direct provenance\nto the processes of diplomacy, then the documentary itineraries they trace enable\nnot simply a reconstruction of diplomatic practice at \ufb01ner resolutions of detail, but\nalso an appreciation of the administrative procedures, organizational logic, and\ncultural practices of the Chos \u014fn state that made diplomacy possible in the \ufb01rst\nplace. On a methodological level, a move away from seeing these texts as doc-umenting interstate relations per se to reading them in terms of the practices\nthat created them is also tantamount to a move toward a different kind of diplo-\nmatic history, one not about the nature of relations between states, but about diplo-macy \u2019s culture and practices.

Despite its appearance as a lone volume,the Kyujanggak Koew\u014fnt\u016dngnok is in fact the missing third volume of another series of\nmanuscripts held at Kyujanggak, labeled as the Koew\u014fn kyedal\n\u69d0\u9662\u5553\u9054(Reports to the\nThrone from the Pagoda Tree Hall ). The Kyedal also contains a running ledger of commu-\nnications between the royal court and the Of \ufb01ce of Diplomatic Correspondence and their\nadministrative decisions from 1743 to 1887. The series is incomplete, with only eleven ofseventeen fascicles surviving. Volume 2 spans 1755 to 1764, leaving off exactly where the\u201cthird\u201dfascicle of the Koew\u014fnt\u016dngnok begins. The fourth fascicle is missing, but since\nvolume 5 begins from 1783, one can surmise it covered activities from 1775 to 1783.See also Kim Ky \u014fngnok, \u201cKoew\u014fn kyedal haeje \u201d;S\u016dngmunw \u014fn,Koew\u014fn kyedal , Kyu\n27012, Kyujanggak Archives.\n67.

This formula for understanding pre-\nnineteenth-century diplomacy in East Asia has received its fair share of criticism \nsince its influential scholarly articulation in the work of John King Fairbank.1 But \nfor being overly general, anachronistic, Sinocentric, reductively functionalist, and \nculturally essentialist, its hold on Ming-Korea relations nevertheless remains tena-\ncious. Its tenacity reflects in part the utility of the \u201ctributary system\u201d as an analytical \nframework for scholars and the malleability of tributary practices and institutions, \nwhich were used in flexible ways by both parties for domestic legitimation and for-\neign relations.2 Korean embassies were also notable for the frequency, regularity, and \nintensity of participation in Ming tributary practices. They arrived in the Ming capi-\ntal at least three times a year. Unlike most other groups along the Ming\u2019s maritime \nand land frontier, the Korean court also professed (at least in the context of these \nembassies) shared cultural values and an ideological commitment to Ming claims of \nuniversal sovereignty. Both countries were administered by a Confucian elite who \ncould communicate with one another through literary Chinese (also referred to as \nclassical Chinese or literary Sinitic). In other words, whatever the faults of the \u201ctribu-\ntary system\u201d as a descriptor in general, the Ming-Korea case seems to fit the bill as a \n\u201cparadigmatic\u201d, if one-of-a-kind, example of tributary relations, with Korea stereo-\ntyped as imperial China\u2019s most loyal vassal.3\nThis stereotype has its origins in historical Chinese perceptions of what Korea \nmeant for the imperial project. The primary narrative of Ming relations with Korea \nthat could be gleaned from official imperial historiography concerns precisely mat-\nters of imperial legitimacy. When Korea appears in the laconic entries of the Ming \nVeritable Records , it is usually in the context of routine tribute embassies, espe-\ncially those who arrived to participate in the New Year\u2019s rituals.

It largely reproduces the contours of Ming official sources, with \na shared concern with imperial legitimacy extending into detailed coverage of how \nthe Qing managed to replace the Ming as Korea\u2019s tributary overlord.6\nThe prominence of these topics\u2014dynastic transition, imperial legitimacy, and the \nMing defense of Korea\u2014reflect the historiographical concerns of the late imperial \nChinese state, and revolve around the issue of Korea\u2019s status as a tributary vassal. \nBut it takes two to tango. Korea too played a part in shaping this relationship. As \nJi-Young Lee has recently argued, the resilience of the Ming tributary institutions \nand practices have as much to do with the domestic interests of the states and rulers \nwho participated in it as it does with Ming imperial ambitions and cannot simply \nbe reduced to a function of Ming imposition or the logical consequence of shared \nConfucian culture.7 While it is hard to gainsay the importance of relations with the \nMing for Korea, the view from Chinese official historiography is a pale reflection of \nthe total picture. The preoccupation with tribute as a function of Ming legitimacy \noccludes whole swaths of the diplomatic experience: practices of envoy poetry,8 cul-\ntural competition,9 Korean realpolitik ,10 the importance of language interpreters,11 \nthe impact on Korean domestic politics,12 and Korea\u2019s lateral relations with the \nMing\u2019s other northeast Asian \u201ctributaries\u201d: the Jurchens, Japanese, and Ry \u016bky\u016bans.13 \nAll in all, a much more in-depth and nuanced understanding of Ming-Korea relations \nhave developed to not only challenge the once dominant, stereotypical view, but also \nbroaden our understanding of how interstate relations operated in East Asia during \nthe Ming period. Given the limitations of space, this chapter cannot provide a com-\nprehensive discussion of the ramifications of these insights. What it will offer instead \nare snapshots of two facets of Ming-Korean interactions before the cataclysmic Imjin \nWar, the value of envoy travel for the Korean court as a vehicle for information \ngathering and the role of Korean-born eunuchs as mediators between the Ming and \nKorean courts that will both complement and challenge the usual diplomatic history \nof this period.\nMING-CHOS \u014eN RELATIONS AT A GLANCE:  \nKOREAN MISSIONS TO BEIJING\nWhen Zhu Yuanzhang expelled the Mongols from Dadu (Beijing) in \u0086\u0085\u0084\u0083, Korea \nwas ruled by the Kory \u014f dynasty ( \u0080\u0086\u0083\u2013\u0086\u0085\u0080\u0082).

A military \nman from the north whose ancestors had served the Mongols for generations, Yi \nS\u014fnggye lacked the genealogical credentials of the traditional Kory \u014f aristocracy. As \na usurper, he had to move quickly to eliminate pockets of domestic resistance. He \nsought external legitimation from the Ming, requesting patents of investiture from \nthe Ming that would have recognized him as Korea\u2019s new ruler. He also invited \nthe Ming emperor to choose from two options a new name for his state. The Ming \nemperor selected Chaoxian, or Chos \u014fn in Korean, calling it the \u201cmost beautiful name \namong the eastern barbarians.\u201d15 But, he remained mistrustful of Yi S \u014fnggye, refus-\ning to grant him investiture.16 Ming-Korean relations again lurched from one crisis to \nanother until \u0086\u0085\u0080\u0083, when the Ming emperor had died, spurring a succession dispute \nbetween the legitimate successor, Jianwen, and his uncle Zhu Di.

The bulk \nof envoy travel fell on the shoulders of the Korean court, which timed three annual \nenvoy missions to fit the Ming ritual calendar: the New Year, the emperor\u2019s birth-\nday, and the birthday of the heir apparent.\nThe range of purposes an envoy mission served far exceeded the scope of these \nexpress ceremonial functions. A considerable number of Ming embassies, especially \nduring the first decades, were to extract needed resources from Korea, notably oxen \nand horses, not simply tokens of symbolic fealty. The Chos \u014fn court also valued their \nmissions to the Ming capital for much more than to seek political legitimacy and \nsecurity assurances. While an envoy\u2019s official task in Beijing could be to present \ntribute and felicitations, his portfolio reflected a much wider range of concerns.18 \nThey often had to carry out specific orders. For instance, Sejong ordered his envoys \nto research Ming ceremonial regalia in \u0086\u007f\u0085}. By the sixteenth century, these prac-\ntices became matters of routine. One member of the envoy mission, the Corrector \n(chij\u014fnggwan) was charged with investigating Ming ritual and institutional practices, \n\u2014 wvutsrq  \u0082\u0085: Korean eunuchs as imperial envoys \u2014\n\u007f\u0084\u0085as well as to consult Ming officials and literati regarding matters of classical scholar-\nship.19 The travelogue of the Corrector for the \u0086\u0081}\u0084 embassy, Cho H \u014fn (\u0086\u0081\u007f\u007f\u2013\u0080\u0082), \nreported his observations of Ming customs, institutions, and rituals. Impressed with \nChina\u2019s urban economic development as well as its cultural accomplishments, Cho \nhighlighted aspects of Ming society worthy for Korean emulation.20 But proposals for \nreforming Korean society along Ming lines were seldom taken-up wholesale. Even \nfor the zealous Cho H \u014fn, his search for Ming models was highly selective, reflecting \nhis own philosophical and political agenda.21\nAlongside this research, Chos \u014fn envoys eagerly sought out the newest Ming \nbooks.22 This bibliophilia generally impressed Ming observers, but in one case it \nraised an alarm. A Korean envoy had been discovered purchasing the Gazetteer of \nthe Great Ming Unification , a geographical text court officials believed should not \nfall into foreign hands.23 In general, book purchases were to augment the holdings \nof the government libraries, and thus focused on works of learning. One Chos \u014fn \nking, Y\u014fnsan\u2019gun, however, also asked his envoys to indulge his interest in Chinese \nromances, by purchasing titles such as the Story of the Western Chamber  (Xixiang ji ) \nand the Story of Alluring Crimson  (Jiaohong ji ).24\nKorean court records documented these and other requests for exotic luxuries like \nlychee, longans, and betel nuts with disapproval.25 Though maligned, they were only \natypical because a king had asked for these particular objects. Y \u014fnsan\u2019gun\u2019s repeated \ndemands that his envoys bring back \u201clicentious and frivolous\u201d goods were evidence \nof an unrestrained royal character, unfit for rule, and justified his later dethroning (a \nmatter which", "doc_id": "03ed1bf8-2e9b-489d-b31f-c2921eb14a10", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "d01ac2e3fb5420fb43bbd86c9b170e832b5038cc4c3aaa95a449bf776e7d504b", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 9559, "end": 13142}, "relationships": {"1": "b82d83d7-0f4f-4000-94ec-dfafdbfb825d", "2": "75e6c2db-7bef-4610-929f-f7697e0cd1a9", "3": "90a39c57-8da2-4ed7-a4fb-818b8535e920"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "90a39c57-8da2-4ed7-a4fb-818b8535e920": {"__data__": {"text": "\nking, Y\u014fnsan\u2019gun, however, also asked his envoys to indulge his interest in Chinese \nromances, by purchasing titles such as the Story of the Western Chamber  (Xixiang ji ) \nand the Story of Alluring Crimson  (Jiaohong ji ).24\nKorean court records documented these and other requests for exotic luxuries like \nlychee, longans, and betel nuts with disapproval.25 Though maligned, they were only \natypical because a king had asked for these particular objects.

Other kings made special orders \nbefore and after, while the journeys of their own officials were in part funded by \ntrade in tropical commodities such as peppercorn.26 Members of the embassy, envoy-\nofficials, interpreters, and even their porters, profited from this opportunity for trade, \ndespite royal injunctions against it. At times, even high-ranking court officials were \ncaught abetting the smuggling of porcelains, books, and silks.27\nNEWS FROM THE MING: EMBASSIES AS  \nINTELLIGENCE GATHERING\nChos\u014fn envoys were also charged with intelligence gathering. Given the sheer num-\nber of individual envoy missions and resulting reports, the information collected was \nwide-ranging. Nevertheless, matters of war and peace, Ming imperial politics, and \nthe presence of other tributary envoys were perennial concerns. The Yongle emper-\nor\u2019s military expansion in Mongolia, for instance, caused a stir at the Korean court, \nas some Korean officials believed the Ming would turn to Korea afterward. Though \na false alarm, the Chos \u014fn court remained wary of the Yongle emperor\u2019s penchant \nfor \u201cvainglory\u201d and remained on the look-out for overweening imperial ambition.28\nIn documenting the Ming\u2019s other foreign contacts, Chos \u014fn envoys also reported on \nthe first European emissaries to arrive at the Ming court in \u0086\u0081\u0086\u0084. The embassy, led by \nthe Lisbon apothecary Tom\u00e9 Pires (ca, \u0086\u007f\u0084\u0081\u2013\u0086\u0081\u0082\u007f) on behalf of the Portuguese king \nManuel I, ended disastrously. The Portuguese had recently conquered Malacca and \ntheir aggressive presence in the South Sea led the Ming to suspect their intentions and \neventually the expulsion of the Portuguese in \u0086\u0081\u0082\u0085 and their subsequent exclusion \nfrom Chinese ports.29 Before this dramatic denou\u00e9ment, Tom\u00e9 Pires and his embassy \n\u2014 Sixiang Wang \u2014\n\u007f\u0084\u007fremained in Beijing, where they encountered a Korean embassy.30 In an audience with \nthe Chos \u014fn king, the returning Korean emissaries identified them as envoys from the \ncountry of the \u201cFranks\u201d (Korean: Pullanggi , Chinese: Folangji), a usage derived from \nan Arab-Islamic convention for describing Christian Europe.

They ate \u201cchicken and wheat products,\u201d which led \nthe envoy to surmise that these must be the \u201csole produce\u201d of their faraway country. \nAccording to the report, these \u201cFrankish\u201d envoys had complained about their shoddy \nlodging, which led the Ming Board of Rites to deny them an imperial audience for \nthree years.31 Meeting such strange foreigners were rather exceptional; more com-\nmon during a sojourn to Beijing were encounters with embassies from other civilized \ncountries such as the Ry \u016bky\u016bs and Vietnam, with whom Korean envoys occasionally \nexchanged poems and letters in classical Chinese.32\nKorean envoys also paid close attention to the shifting landscape of power at the \nMing court. When envoys reported that the Grand Secretary Xia Yan ( \u0086\u007f\u0083\u0082\u2013\u0086\u0081\u007f\u0083), \nwhose support Chos \u014fn envoys counted on,33 had been impeached, the Chos \u014fn knew \nthey had to work on his replacement, Yan Song ( \u0086\u007f\u0083~\u2013\u0086\u0081\u0084}).34 Knowing that Yan \nheld the keys to power, the Chos \u014fn valued the relationship with Yan and acceded to \nhis requisitions for special gifts, in particular, for Korean memorial paper.35 When \nYan had rebuffed a Korean petition for revising sections of the Ming Compendium  \n(Da Ming huidian) the Chos \u014fn found offensive, it dropped the issue, knowing full \nwell attempting to circumvent him would have been fruitless.36\nAs Korean emissaries kept an eye on the state of Ming politics, the Chos \u014fn became \nprivy to court intrigue and palace coups, along with the personal moral failings of \nthe Ming emperor. Korean envoy testimonies spoke of the scandal and violence that \nsurrounded the nexus of imperial power. As historians of China have long noted, \nChos\u014fn record-keepers, unconcerned with the taboos of l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 , had no com-\npunction casting the imperial person or his rule in a negative light.37 Chos\u014fn envoys \nrelated in gory detail the aftermath of the attempted coup by the palace eunuch Cao \nJixiang in \u0086\u007f\u0084\u0086. When this massive mutiny of Mongol military units in the Ming \ncapital was suppressed, several thousand were dead with eight hundred executed by \nslicing.

According to his informants, a \nKorean nurse who once served the Korean concubines and a Korean-born eunuch \nat the Ming palace, the women were implicated in a series of purges and massacres. \n\u2014 wvutsrq  \u0082\u0085: Korean eunuchs as imperial envoys \u2014\n\u007f\u0084\u0081A Chinese concubine by the name of L\u00fc tried to befriend a Korean concubine, Lady \nY\u014f, by claiming virtual kinship with her on the basis of their shared surname (which \nthough is pronounced differently in modern Korean and Chinese, are written with \nthe same Chinese character). Lady Y \u014f, however, snubbed L\u00fc. The spurned Lady L\u00fc \nsought vengeance against Y \u014f by accusing her of poisoning another Korean concu-\nbine, Lady Kw \u014fn, causing her death. The emperor, who had favored Kw \u014fn, was \nenraged, and executed Lady Y \u014f along with several hundred others, including many \nof the Korean palace ladies. Later L\u00fc was discovered to have engaged in sexual rela-\ntions with palace eunuchs. The emperor questioned her servants under torture, who \nconfessed to conspiring to assassinate the emperor. The Yongle emperor personally \nattended to their executions by dismemberment. In all, two thousand eight hundred \nindividuals perished. Upon her demise, one palace woman cursed the emperor say-\ning, \u201cIt was your own penis that shriveled, how could you have blamed [Lady L\u00fc] \nfor having an affair with a young eunuch?\u201d When the Yongle emperor died, only \ntwo Korean concubines survived him, but they were forced to commit suicide to \naccompany the emperor in his grave.40\nThese salacious details, while admittedly difficult to verify, escaped the confines \nof the inner palace, and traveled with envoys back to Korea to be preserved in the \nrecords kept by the Chos \u014fn\u2019s court historians. Whatever one makes of the Chos \u014fn \ncourt\u2019s \u201cadmiration\u201d of Chinese high culture and political allegiance to the Ming \nthrone, it entertained no romantic fantasies about the Ming.

According to the report, after this incident, no one else \ndared remonstrate with the emperor.43\nFrom the emperor\u2019s infatuation with a young catamite leading to disinterest in his \nharem, to the outbreak of rebellions led by imperial princes, reports of the Zhengde \nemperor\u2019s troubled reign continued to flow into the Chos \u014fn court.44 In the months \nbefore the boy-emperor\u2019s premature death in \u0086\u0081\u0082\u0086, the Korean court even weighed \nthe risks of the Ming\u2019s collapse, but the envoys assured the king the common people \nwere not \u201cespecially worried or anguished\u201d and \u201ccourt officials still managed all \naffairs with utmost diligence.\u201d45\n\u2014 Sixiang Wang \u2014\n\u007f\u0084\u0084Pithy appraisals of nearly every Ming ruler can be found in Korean sources.

In part the diplomatic framework built over the years \nhad worked well enough to provide the political legitimacy, cultural and economic \naccess, and security guarantees the Chos \u014fn court desired. It may not be very accu-\nrate, however, to reduce the meaning of Korean participation to any one of the \nabove priorities. Nor should Korean participation in the Ming tribute system be \nunderstood as simply a matter of cultural attraction or ideological commitment. \nWhile it is true the Chos \u014fn courtiers and rulers alike turned to Ming examples \nas a source of authority for their arguments, they served more as case examples \nof statecraft in action, rather than a model for unqualified emulation. During \none royal lecture in \u0086\u0081~\u0080, King Chungjong\u2019s advisers described their own expe-\nriences from traveling to Ming Beijing. One named S \u014fng H\u016diy\u014fn (\u0086\u007f\u0084\u0086\u2013\u0086\u0081\u0086\u0085) \nrecounted a case when a Ming high-official was punished with severe beatings \nover a minor offense. Lamenting the excessiveness of Ming punitive measures, \nS\u014fng then implored the king to exercise leniency when it came to the punishment \nof his own officials. In the same lecture, S \u014fng praised the Ming\u2019s use of a system-\natic mechanism for assessing the merits and accomplishments of court officials. \nA subtext of the censure of Ming imperial excesses were veiled criticisms against \nthe abuses committed by Korea\u2019s own rulers.51 Ultimately such discussions were \ntied up, first and foremost, with Korean concerns.

The sea-\nfarer Zheng He, with his many voyages to the Indian Ocean, was but the most famous \nof these eunuch-diplomats.55 Often, eunuchs were sent to their place of cultural or \nethnic origin. Korea was no exception. Many of the eunuch emissaries the Ming sent \nthere were natives of Korea.56\nThe documentary record of Ming-Korean diplomacy, with its epistles, poetry \nanthologies, and travelogues, resulted from exchanges between Ming literati officials \nand their Korean counterparts, but they reflect poorly the social constitution of Ming \ndiplomacy for most of the fifteenth and early sixteenth century.57 From \u0086\u0085\u0080\u0082 to \u0086\u007f\u0084\u0080, \nthe period of highest diplomatic activity between the Ming and Chos \u014fn, eunuchs led \n\u0084\u0085 out of \u0086~\u0081 Ming embassies, while literati officials only led \u0082\u0082. The bulk of the dip-\nlomatic burden fell on the shoulder of the eunuchs of the inner palace.58 Their value \nto the Ming emperor was their awareness of local conditions, which presumably \nincluded competence in the local language, but this competence was not universal. \nOne Sin Kwisaeng was mistaken for a Chinese because he refused to speak Korean. \nTaken for arrogance, this refusal may very well have been due to lack of ability. \nSent as tribute to China often as young boys, they might not retain or develop skills \nin Korean. Indeed, some clearly depended on Chinese-speaking Korean interpreters \nemployed by the Korean court during their travels to Korea.59\nThe presence of Korean eunuchs at the imperial court was in part a Mongol \nlegacy. Under the Mongol empire, many Korean elites, including the royal family, \nintermarried with the Mongols. When Korean women entered the households of \nMongol aristocracy, which included the imperial harem, they were also accompanied \nby their servants from Korea. The chief consort of China\u2019s last Mongol emperor was \na Korean woman, Empress Ki (fl. \u0086\u0085\u007f~\u2013\u0084\u0083), who had at her beck and call a vast \nnumber of eunuchs, including her favorite, a Korean named Pak Bukha.60 When Zhu \nYuanzhang reached Beijing in \u0086\u0085\u0084\u0083, the Mongol imperial entourage fled in haste, \nleaving behind much of the palace personnel. Among them were Korean eunuchs \nwho continued to serve the Ming. In \u0086\u0085\u0080\u0081, the Ming emperor allowed those who \nwere still alive to retire, repatriating them to their home country, Korea.61 In the \nmeantime, Chos \u014fn Korea continued to send intermittent tribute of castrated boys to \nsupply the Ming court with fresh personnel.62\nWhen some returned to Korea as official envoys, they were often tasked with \nthe procurement of tribute. This included not only exotic goods, but also human \ntribute in the form of young women and more eunuchs.

A human tribute responsible for procuring \nmore of his kind, the Korean eunuch represents well the extractive practices of the \nMing empire.63\nSERVANTS OF TWO MASTERS: THE KOREAN  \nEUNUCH AS MEDIATOR\nAs their personal slaves, the eunuchs of emperors were often charged with tasks \nthe emperors wished to conceal from the civil bureaucracy. The Chos \u014fn court sus-\npected the Xuande emperor to have done as much when he sought Korean women \nfor his harem.64 By relaying oral edicts, rather than proclaiming written declarations, \na eunuch could execute orders with no paper trail.65 But it was precisely their posi-\ntion as agents of the emperor, as opposed to members of literati-dominated civil \nbureaucracy, that made them useful for the Chos \u014fn court. At times when the Ming \nbureaucracy proved intractable toward Chos \u014fn demands, a Korean eunuch with \nstrong ties to the emperor and his household could resolve them by circumventing \nthe usual bureaucratic channels.66 Although the emperor\u2019s slave, the Korean eunuch \nalso mediated Chos \u014fn\u2019s relationship with the Ming.\nThe loyalties and motivations of Korean-born eunuchs were the subject of suspi-\ncion. As natives of Korea in Ming service, their persons were contested by overlapping \nsovereign claims. In \u0086\u007f\u0084\u0083, one Ming official in Liaodong, Hou Ying ( \u0086\u007f\u0085~\u2013?) wrote \nthe following in a memorial to argue for why the practice of employing Korean \neunuchs as envoys should cease:\nThe eunuchs Ch \u014fng Tong and Ch\u2019oe An have gone to Chos \u014fn to invest [the new \nChos\u014fn king] . . . but they are both people of Chos \u014fn.

All \nMing envoys took a superior position when proclaiming imperial edicts, for in such a \nritual context, the envoy stands not as himself, but the vehicle of the emperor\u2019s voice. \nWhen the ceremony concluded and the imperial edict was received by the Chos \u014fn \nking, so too the imperial aura around the envoy dispersed. In the more informal \ncourt audiences that followed, Ming literati envoys usually took a position of parity \nwith the Chos \u014fn king. In contrast, the eunuch Ch \u014fng Tong offered to relinquish his \nritual position, and insisted the Chos \u014fn king occupy a position of symbolic superi-\nority: facing south. The Chos \u014fn king declined, and insisted that their proposal was \na \u201cbreach of precedent.\u201d Ch \u014fng insisted that the king \u201cface south\u201d and he \u201cface \nnorth\u201d because they, as \u201ccommoners native\u201d to Chos \u014fn, should observe the rites of \n\u201cruler and subject.\u201d The Korean eunuchs then remained \u201cprostrated on the floor\u201d \n\u2014 wvutsrq  \u0082\u0085: Korean eunuchs as imperial envoys \u2014\n\u007f\u0084\u0080until the Chos \u014fn king reluctantly accepted the ritual elevation as his sovereign.68 \nAnother envoy, Kang Ok, insisted on the same, exclaiming that he \u201cwas but a slave \nof this country, whose flesh and bone are all gifts of his majesty\u2019s grace. In his reason-\ning, the \u201cpublic ritual\u201d performed in the main palace halls had already concluded; \nnow that they were in the king\u2019s private chambers, a \u201cprivate ritual\u201d where he was \nto make personal obeisance to the Korean king was to take place.69 Explained as \nexpressions of affinity to native place, ritual deference to the Korean king (\u201cWe were \noriginally commoners of this land, please allow us to kowtow to Your Majesty\u201d) \nmay have been rooted in genuine sentiments, or at least a recognition of the Korean \nruler\u2019s importance to their interests.70 King Sejo, for instance, personally selected the \nboys who were to go to the Ming as eunuchs. One, the eunuch Kim Po, credited the \nking\u2019s graces for his \u201cfortune\u201d of being able to serve the emperor and return home \nin glory as an imperial emissary.71\nDespite these professions of fealty, these eunuchs\u2019 relationship with their home \ncountry was ambivalent. When Kang Ok and Kim Po returned to Korea for the first \ntime in \u0086\u007f\u0084\u0083 as imperial emissaries, the Chos \u014fn court reunited them with their sur-\nviving family members in the capital.72 When the relatives arrived, the court granted \nthese relatives a variety of requests\u2014ranging from speedy and favorable conclusions \nto lawsuits, amnesty from prior legal violations, to reprieve from corv\u00e9e obligations\u2014\nall to ingratiate themselves with the Ming emissaries.73 But the day of reunion made \nfor a bittersweet homecoming.

Kang Ok learned from two surviving relatives that \nhis mother had died fourteen years ago, a discovery which led him to \u201cweep bitterly \nwithout end.\u201d Kim Po received his father and older brother at his hostel in Kaes \u014fng, \nbut he refused to entertain his three uncles, blaming them for inciting his father to \nabandon his mother.74 About two weeks later, Kim Po\u2019s mother arrived in the capital. \nKim went to pay his respects, the two \u201cheld each other and wept with overwhelming \nbitterness.\u201d He assured his mother that her suffering would soon end, because the \nking was willing to grant his older brother an official salary and they no longer had \nto live with his father who \u201cnow loved his second wife.\u201d He then scolded his father: \n\u201cyou have treated my mother so poorly, but today you drink my wine. Are you not \nashamed?\u201d In his fury, he then turned to his ten-year-old half-brother, the child of his \nhated stepmother. He slapped the child repeatedly, while swearing to bring the child \nto the palace in Beijing, presumably as a eunuch. But in the chaos the boy ran away \nand could not be found.75\nTo take the boy with him, Kang would have needed to make the request to the \nChos\u014fn king. Had the boy not escaped (and thwarted his older brother Kang Ok\u2019s \nchance at retribution), the king would have likely granted the request, for the Chos \u014fn \ncourt disbursed numerous favors to the eunuchs and their families. These included \nbuilding or repairing their families\u2019 residences, titles of nobility for deceased parents \nand ancestors, official posts and stipends to living relatives, and pilgrimages to the \nsacred Diamond Mountains (K \u016dmgangsan).76 This generosity owed at least in part \nto the value these imperial emissaries had for the Chos \u014fn court. For this particu-\nlar Chos \u014fn king, Sejo, good relations with the Ming inner palace was crucial for \nthe success of the coup d\u2019etat that led to his accession and the concealment of this \nreality from the Ming court.77 For his grandson, King S \u014fngjong, the access granted \nto the inner palace through these Korean-born eunuchs served him well in manag-\ning a series of political challenges, including a troublesome Ming trade embargo on \n\u2014 Sixiang Wang \u2014\n\u007f}~the export of buffalo horns, a critical raw material for manufacturing war bows.78 \nSustaining this useful relationship of course was not simply lingering native loyalties, \nbut also what the Chos \u014fn court could offer.\nPerhaps most valued by these eunuchs was a contribution towards their position \nin the Ming palace hierarchy.

According to the Korean king Sejong, these rare and magnificent birds \nwere \u201cvalued as priceless objects, treasures of the first order in China.\u201d79 Known as \nhaidongqing  in Chinese, they were not perennial denizens of Korea, but migrated \nsouth from the Arctic Circle in the winter. Their capture required either the help \nof Jurchen tribesmen or the dispatch of experienced falconers to Korea\u2019s northeast \nfrontier.80 Once, in \u0086\u007f\u0081\u0082, Chos\u014fn refused a Ming eunuch envoy\u2019s request for these \nbirds and instead sent them to the emperor as a separate tribute, so that \u201cthey would \nbe seen as gifts from Chos \u014fn,\u201d and not the merit of the eunuch.81 Later that year, \nthen only a Korean prince, the future King Sejo seized power through a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat.  \nWith his eye on the throne, he proved more forthcoming to the demands from eunuch \nenvoys whose cooperation he required. With no gyrfalcons on hand, he granted a \nwhite eagle to his guests as a \u201cgift to the emperor.\u201d82\nThe gyrfalcon tribute, connected with the institution of the imperial hunt, was a \ncontroversial issue at the Ming court. Ming emperors, their eunuchs, and the civil \nbureaucracy had different opinions, with the latter protesting their propriety.83 \nIn \u0086\u007f\u0084}, following one such debate, an imperial edict arrived in Korea declaring: \n\u201cEver since We [the Chenghua emperor] acceded to the throne, We have already \nproclaimed to all places prohibiting tributes of flowers, trees, birds and beasts. \nWhat more of white pheasants, prodigious objects, and gyrfalcons, used as hunting \nbirds?\u201d and ordering King Sejo to refrain from sending such tribute.84 Dubious of the \nMing court\u2019s sincerity, Sejo ordered local officials in the northern frontier to make \n\u201cadvance preparations\u201d in case the tribute was to be renewed, even as he dispatched \nan emissary to offer thanks for the tribute reprieve.85\nThe Ming had \u201ccanceled\u201d such tribute several times before, only to reinstate it \nafterward.86 One year later, when the eunuchs Kang Ok and Kim Po arrived, they \nmade demands, not for gyrfalcons per se, but other kinds of animals: lynxes, yellow \nhawks, and hunting dogs.87 When a Korean official rebuffed the request, citing the \nimperial edict prohibiting tribute of exotic fauna, the two envoys offered conflicting \nresponses. Kang Ok insinuated this prohibition could be safely ignored, but his assis-\ntant Kim Po apologized, professing ignorance of the imperial orders. But when the \ndate of their return approached, the two envoys stalled, leading the court to suspect \nthey were still waiting for these items as parting gifts.88 Several days later, when Sejo \noffered to capture these animals for him, Kang Ok was \u201coverjoyed\u201d but citing the \nprohibition against presenting \u201cbirds\u201d in particular, declined the offer of gyrfalcons.89 \nMeanwhile, Kim Po explained to the king in private that the whole", "doc_id": "bf9ac227-dda0-42e8-8131-caf9bfc0e80d", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "6e7d7bf4bc3f0074f6e7d06500b65d2eb28898265739228d19a257e7ea1d0b68", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 43992, "end": 47488}, "relationships": {"1": "b82d83d7-0f4f-4000-94ec-dfafdbfb825d", "2": "0751f847-9f94-45d1-9750-bf6badb60c09", "3": "99c498e2-fa4e-4028-86de-2a630280e57b"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "99c498e2-fa4e-4028-86de-2a630280e57b": {"__data__": {"text": "When a Korean official rebuffed the request, citing the \nimperial edict prohibiting tribute of exotic fauna, the two envoys offered conflicting \nresponses.

Ch \u014fng claimed it was he, not Kang, who truly repre-\nsented the emperor\u2019s personal wishes, which had been \u201cdeliberately concealed\u201d from \nKang.91 Their rivalry soon erupted dramatically, and the Chos \u014fn court found itself \ninterceding to mediate in Kang and Ch \u014fng\u2019s tattered relationship.92\nThe extent to which the Chos \u014fn court colluded with these eunuchs became a sore \nissue for the Korean officialdom. They protested what they saw to be the disburse-\nment of emoluments and titles to undeserving men of lesser social standing. They \nalso objected to the court\u2019s tactic of using imperial eunuchs as proxies.93 When the \neunuch Ch \u014fng Tong found that, in the wake of such protests, the Korean king proved \nreluctant to grant his requests, he voiced his grievances, reminding the king of how \nhard he had worked on the king\u2019s behalf in the past:\nHow could the king know about all the things I\u2019ve done for our country? How \ncan the high officials [of Chos \u014fn] know about them? Only heaven knows!

The items included a vast array of ani-\nmal and plant products, including ornate ivory carvings to be crafted to exacting \nspecifications, items that the Korean court had no ability to furnish. The Chos \u014fn \ncourt suspected that these imperial requests were most likely a result of Ch \u014fng\u2019s own \nmachinations, for now he agreed to \u201cdo his best\u201d to help \u201creduce\u201d the tribute quan-\ntity, \u201chowever difficult it may be.\u201d95 Though the Chos \u014fn court repeatedly lamented \nCh\u014fng\u2019s \u201cgreed,\u201d believing that the Ming\u2019s literati-officials would never stoop to such \nlows,96 the fact was, as Ch \u014fng described it and now reminded them, their relationship \nwas reciprocal and symbiotic, if costly and unnerving.97 The link to the inner palace \n\u2014 Sixiang Wang \u2014\n\u007f}\u0082that the Korean eunuchs provided again proved critical in the aftermath of the coup \nd\u2019\u00e9tat of \u0086\u0081~\u0084 that deposed the king Y \u014fnsan\u2019gun in favor of his younger brother, for \nit was the \u201clobbying\u201d efforts of Korean eunuchs in Beijing that ensured the arrival of \nMing patents of investiture for the new king, despite the air of suspicion that hung \nover the succession.98 When these eunuchs returned to Chos \u014fn as emissaries in \u0086\u0081~\u0083, \nthey were none too shy about demanding recompense for their \u201cmerits.\u201d99\nEPILOGUE: END OF AN ERA\nOne of the eunuchs the Chos \u014fn court relied on to conceal the Y \u014fnsan\u2019gun affair was \nChin Ho (fl. \u0086\u0081~\u0084\u2013\u0082\u0082).

This difference has been seen as evidence of a transition from a period \ncharacterized by arbitrary imperial exactions to one of stable relations, rationalized \nand routinized by ritual, protocols, and the force of precedent.101\nThe transition was, however, less stark than such characterizations may initially \nsuggest. It was a gradual one accompanied by other shifts, such as the growing impor-\ntance of literary exchange in diplomacy, that were accretions of smaller, piecemeal \ninstitutional changes. Human tribute did not end because of Hou Ying\u2019s memorial \nagainst the employment of Korean eunuch envoys (as the Ming Veritable Records  \nwould suggest), but rather due to a convergence of several contingencies. One factor \nwas the growing role of envoy poetry and literary exchange in the diplomatic arena. \nWhile the Ming continued to dispatch eunuch envoys to Korea, especially for rituals \nof investiture at the Chos \u014fn court, they were often over-shadowed by their literati \nassistants.102 For instance, Wang Xianchen (fl. \u0086\u007f\u0080\u0085), a scholar-official from Suzhou, \nlater famed for building the renowned Humble Administrator\u2019s Garden ( Zhuozheng \nyuan), a center of late Ming Suzhou literati life (and, now, a modern tourist attrac-\ntion), went to Korea in \u0086\u007f\u0080\u0081 as the third-ranking assistant envoy to a Korean-born \neunuch charged with investing Y \u014fnsan\u2019gun as king. In Korea, he took the spotlight \nas a pedantic ritualist, who insisted on conforming Korean diplomatic ceremonies to \nhis exacting and idiosyncratic standards.103 During the reign of the Hongzhi emperor \n(\u0086\u007f\u0083\u0083\u2013\u0086\u0081~\u0081), eunuch influence waned, but the reign of his son, Zhengde ( \u0086\u0081~\u0084\u2013\u0082\u0086), \nsaw a resurgence in their imperial patronage, and their power. Chin Ho\u2019s \u0086\u007f\u0083\u0085 class \nof Korean tribute eunuchs had by that time matured to occupy important positions \nin the Ming inner palace. Thirty-five years later, Chin Ho, and his assistant Kim \n\u016ci returned to Chos \u014fn in the winter of \u0086\u0081\u0082\u0086, which unbeknownst to them was the \nKorean eunuch mission to Korea, an event to bookend an era.\nThe mission had come about as result of the Zhengde emperor\u2019s investigation into \n\u201cprecedents from the Xuande reign\u201d concerning the reception of Korean envoys. \nBefore the investigation had concluded, Chin Ho alerted a visiting Korean embassy to \nthe emperor\u2019s project, and warned that he would likely discover that his great-great \ngrandfather, the Xuande emperor, once acquired concubines from Korea.

He then proceeded to Seoul with the dead emperor\u2019s orders in tow.107\nWith knowledge of the emperor\u2019s death, the Chos \u014fn court tarried, anticipating the \nedict\u2019s revocation. In the meantime, how much and what to comply with remained \nan open question.108 King Chungjong recognized that the \u201ceunuchs of our country \n(Korea)\u201d had often \u201cbeen of aid in matters at the Central Court.\u201d With only but a \n\u201cfew remaining\u201d from the \u0086\u007f\u0083\u0086 contingent, sending more tribute was the only way \nto have these valuable contacts in the Ming palace.109 Sending women for the palace, \nhowever, was another matter. This \u201cpreposterous order of the deceased emperor\u201d \nrequired a temporary prohibition of marriage for the selection of tribute virgins\u2014a \ngreat nuisance to the population. Chungjong\u2019s officials exhorted the king to refuse \nthis particular demand.110 Meanwhile, the eunuch envoys sent contradictory signals, \nboth insisting compliance to all the demands and insinuating the Chos \u014fn court could \nstill act according to its own discretion.111\nThe Chos \u014fn court hesitated not because it faced limited options, but rather because \nit had a surfeit of them. It wished to proceed from a morally and ritually unassailable \nposition. As for where it should lie\u2014that was unclear. The instructions of an impe-\nrial edict were in theory inviolable; however, the emperor who had promulgated it \nwas now dead, which meant his orders might yet be rescinded. To continue with the \nunpopular procurement would not only be unnecessary, but would also call attention \nto the moral faults of the deceased emperor. King Chungjong desired a consensus \nof opinion that was not easily reached. Some officials argued that, by acceding to a \nportion of the imperial demands, it had no grounds to refuse the rest. Other officials \nquestioned the propriety of presenting women for a dead emperor\u2019s harem during the \nperiod of his mourning. Neither could Chos \u014fn excuse itself on grounds of ignorance, \nfor it had already dispatched envoys to the Ming to express condolence.

The Chos \u014fn emissaries dispatched their own messenger to Seoul to inform \nthe court of the envoy\u2019s intent. They presented a verbatim copy of the Ming edict, \nwhich contained orders for the Ming commander to arrest Kim \u016ci and Chin Ho. \nThe edict accused the two eunuchs of \u201cignoring the gravity of the imperial mission, \nbeing unbridled in their greed, conspiring for profits beyond established precedent, \n[and exploiting] foreign barbarians to indulge in their own pleasures,\u201d among other \n\u2014 Sixiang Wang \u2014\n\u007f}\u007fcrimes. Lest the \u201ceastern barbarians [i.e. Koreans] are disappointed\u201d and develop \n\u201csentiments of condescension\u201d toward the imperial court, the envoys were to be \napprehended in \u201cchains and manacles\u201d with their baggage seized and escorted back \nto Beijing for \u201csevere punishment.\u201d The Chos \u014fn court decided to conceal the matter \nfrom their Ming guests, but showed them a heavily redacted version to insinuate that \nthe imperial court expected their immediate return.113\nUnaware of their imminent arrest, they still dallied, and pressed the Chos \u014fn court \nto make good on their earlier requests. Although some officials suggested that the \nChos\u014fn court apprehend the Ming envoys, others argued that it would be better \nto accede to their requests for the time being, and treat them no differently than \nbefore.114 King Chungjong agreed. The language of the imperial edict notwithstand-\ning, there was no way to know whether they would in fact be severely punished upon \ntheir return. The eunuchs, if they remained in power, would then only resent their \nill-treatment and slander Chos \u014fn to the new emperor in revenge.115\nThe decision to treat them deferentially proved judicious. The Liaodong com-\nmander, likely unwilling to make a commotion in lands beyond his jurisdiction, did \nnot attempt to apprehend the Ming envoys, but tried instead to coax them to return. \nWhen the Chos \u014fn court finally received formal notices for recalling Chin and Kim \nfrom the Liaodong commander, there was no longer mention of their arrest. The pro-\ncurement was canceled and the Ming envoys departed.116 True to the prediction of \none Korean interpreter, who told the king that \u201cKim \u016ci and company will certainly \nescape punishment,\u201d the two eunuchs were shortly restored to their original posts.117 \nThe Chos \u014fn court concluded that the Ming knew full well the two were acting under \nthe emperor\u2019s orders, and only scapegoated Chin Ho and Kim \u016ci to deflect blame \nfor the deceased Zhengde emperor.

They have been \nblamed summarily for leading young and ambitious emperors on vainglorious mili-\ntary adventures, for manning a secret police apparatus intended to terrorize the \nscholar-official bureaucracy, and for the downfall of the dynasty itself.119 As seen \nin this chapter, Korean writings about Ming eunuchs, Korean or otherwise, are \nno less flattering and depict them as overbearing, indecorous, and greedy. Perhaps \nbecause eunuchs seldom have descendants to defend them, they serve as conveni-\nent scapegoats for endemic structural features of the Ming state or the excesses of \nimperial autocracy.\nWhen it comes to foreign relations, one strand of interpretation treats the employ-\nment of eunuchs as an aberration of how a Confucian tributary relationship ought \nto function. As one modern historian put it, eunuchs \u201cinterfered\u201d with politics, and \nacted against the spirit of their emperors, who repeatedly attempted to curtail their \nabuses.120 Indeed, the extractive and exploitative practices associated with eunuch \nemissaries contrasts starkly with the professed Confucian ideals of Ming empire \nwhere \u201cmen afar\u201d such as the Koreans, are supposed to be \u201ccherished\u201d ( rouyuan \n\u2014 wvutsrq  \u0082\u0085: Korean eunuchs as imperial envoys \u2014\n\u007f}\u0081neng\u2019er) and turns on its head the principle of magnanimity where foreign emissar-\nies are supposed to \u201carrive with little\u201d but be sent off \u201cwith much\u201d (Ch: houwang \nbolai). Such scapegoating, which portrays \u201cunreasonable and arbitrary demands\u201d \nas working \u201coutside of the system\u201d, shifts all moral hazard of extraction and coer-\ncion onto these eunuchs, conveniently preserving the \u201cmoral\u201d tenor of the Ming \ndiplomatic practice as an institution guided by \u201crituals and norms.\u201d121 Of course \nthese extractive practices, though rendered marginal when one adopts the gaze and \nvalues of Korea and China\u2019s Confucian elite, were just as fundamental to Ming-\nKorea relations as the Confucian moral and political ideals that supposedly guided \nthem.

This sort of allegorical  logic has long informed  the reading  of \nQian \u2019s life. The following  anecdote  has played  an important  part in biogra \u00ad\nphies of Qian. When  Qing forces  came to take Nanjing  from the Southern  \nMing,  Qian \u2019s wife Liu Rushi  tried to convince  Qian to commit  suicide  with  \nher by jumping  into the river Yangzi.  Neither  fulfilled  this act of loyal mar\u00ad\ntyrdom,  because  Qian stole away from the frigid  water  at the last \ncomplaining  of its temperature.  He then opened  the city gates and \ndered  to the Qing.  In this narrative,  if he had followed  his wife \u2019s advice  and \ndied, he would  almost certainly  have earned  a reputation  of a loyalist.  Later  \naccounts  attribute  these lines to Qian: \u201cWailing  at the river's  edge, there  \nwere no filial sons; but accompanying  me in hardship,  she was a worthy  \nwife\u201d\u81e8\u6c5f\u615f\u54ed\u7121\u5b5d\u5b50\u5f9e\u884c\u8d74\u96e3\u6709\u8ce2\u59bb .With  filiality,  and by extension  the \nfather-son  relationship,  foundational  to other  moral  relations,  his cowardicemoment,\nsurren-\nand surrender  pointed  to a broader  moral  failure,  magnified  only  by contrast \u00ad\ning moral  constancy  of his wife. 24 For both  Qian  and his later  biographers,  the \nactions  of his wife Liu Rushi  vicariously  fulfilled  a moral  will frustrated  by \nQian \u2019s personal  weakness.  In this reading,  Qian later  supported  Ming  loyalist  \nactivities  to mend  his broken  reputation.  These  acts, together  with Qian \u2019s ef\u00ad\nforts to preserve  the Ming  through  writing,  substituted  for the suicide  he had \nfailed  to perform.\nTo apply  this logic  to Qian \u2019s treatment  of Korean  loyalists,  especially  that \nof Chong  Mongju,  is to understand  it as follows:  if Qian  could  not die for his \nstate, then perhaps,  he could at least celebrate  those who did die for their  \nstates.  Describing  their  impeccable  loyalist  credentials  demonstrated,  at least,  \nQian \u2019s commitment  to the ideal  of loyalty,  especially  since  his own reputation  \nas a loyalist  had been tarnished  by his service  to the Qing.  Chong  resisted  the \nChoson,  died, and was honored  for it; Qian served  the Qing, lived,  and \nblamed  for it.

By identifying  loyalist  deaths  with unwavering  \nmoral  rectitude,  the royal  celebration  of absolute  devotion  implicitly  absolved \nthe new rulers of any moral responsibility  for those deaths.  In this moral  \neconomy,  neither  the Manchus  nor the Yi house  could  be blamed  for causing \nthe deaths  of those who remained  loyal to the previous  regime,  since it was \ntheir duty as loyal officials  to die anyway.  In Chong  Mongju \u2019s case, for ex\u00ad\nample,  the petition  that called  for his rehabilitation  emphasized  his \u201cunceas- \ning.. devotion  to the Koryo  house,  despite  his knowledge  that the dynasty  was \ndoomed. 37\nQian, on the other hand, postulates  alternative  relationships  among  Ioy- \nalty, defiance,  and death in his Korean  biographies.  He treated  Yi Songgye,  \nthe Choson  founder,  as a usurper,  underscoring  the moral  culpability  of  rulers \nthemselves.  This moral  economy  is thus subtly,  but also fundamentally  differ-  \nent from how rulers,  such as Qianlong  and Yi Pangwon,  conceived  it. Qian \u2019s \nversion  posits  a counternarrative  of loyalty  that precludes  the accommodation  \nof a loyalist \u2019s death to (illegitimate)  monarchical  authority.  Though  this \nstance  conceptually  preempted  the later imperial  revision  of Ming loyalist  \nnarratives,  it did not stop Qianlong  from appropriating  the memories  of the \nvery Ming  martyrs  who defied  his forbears.3S\n36.

Political  upheaval,  however,  could  disrupt  this relationship.  Periods  of \ndynastic  crisis,  such as the Koryo-Choson  transition  of 1392, Jianwen-Yon- \ngle wars of 1398-1402,  or the Ming-Qing  transition  of 1644,  undermined  the \nsanctity  of monarchical  authority,  calling  into question  the proper  role of the \nofficial.  State-sponsored  historiography  often  sought  to preserve  the monar \u00ad\nchy^ moral  legitimacy  by avoiding  direct  implication  of the victors  of these  \nconflicts  of any wrongdoing,  if not exonerating  them  altogether.  These  moves,  \nhowever,  leave unresolved  one major  problem.  How should  the individuals  \nwho perished  because  they remained  loyal to the losing  be understood?  Such \nfigures  are inherently  volatile,  for appraising  their  actions  always  has the  po\u00ad\ntential  to lead to alternative  readings  of the same  events,  potentially  escalat \u00ad\ning into direct  challenge  to the moral  legitimacy  of the victor.\nFor Qian,  history  writing  was one way to exercise  claims  to moral  author \u00ad\nity. For him, the ultimate  source  of moral  authority did not rest with the state,  \nbut rather  with the historian  and his duty to represent  faithfully  the events  of \nthe period  and to overturn  political  injustices.  The historian \u2019s voice in these  \nbiographies  can rectify  the failings  of previous  historical  writing,  cast blame  \nonto unscrupulous  Yi rulers,  and exalt the virtues  of loyal subjects  who \nsisted  them. In the meantime,  Qian affirms  the superiority  of his knowledge  \nto that of official  historiographers  and converts  his erudition  into claims  of \nmoral authority.  Qian \u2019s particular  moral economy  of loyal  ism needs to be \nunderstood  in the context  of his stancere-\nthe purpose  of historical  writing.  \nFor Qian,  good history  had the power  to correct  past wrongs.

On the other \uff0c \nthere  was the task  of sorting  out individuals  whose  allegiances  did not always  \nconverge  with the direction  of political  fortune.  The life of Yi Saek brings  \nQian to confront  this historiographical  conundrum  in his biography.

The logical  conclusion  \nwas that the Choson  founders  had fabricated  these charges  of illegitimacy.  \nThrough  this oblique  technique,  the Korean  historian  fulfilled  his responsi \u00ad\nbility to good historical  writing  by censuring  moral failings,  even of one \u2019s \nown rulers.\nQian \u2019s praise  of the nameless  Korean  historian  contrasts  with his criticism  \nof Ming  official  historiography.  The Korean  histories  were worthy  of emula \u00ad\ntion, validating  a classical  idea that when proper  standards  \nmaintained  in China,  one may \u201clearn  of them  from  the barbarians  of the four \n[directions]  (siyi \u56db\u5937).\u2019M7 Qian takes  the Ming Veritable  Records  to task for \nreproducing  Yi Songgye's  portrayal  of Chos6n \u2019s founding.  In its version  of \nthe events,  Yi was a loyal official  who tried to protect  the Koryo  royal family.  \nChong  Mongju  was portrayed  as a villain.  It was he who misled  the Koryo  \nrulers  and tried to instigate  an invasion  of the Ming  border  region  of Liao\u00ad\ndong.  Yi Songgye,  however,  prevented  these  plans  from  coming  into fruition.  \nChong  Mongju  resented  Yi for thwarting  him and sought  to kill him. The \nVeritable  Records  thus reversed  the moral  roles of these two historical  fig\u00ad\nures. For this oversight,  Qian Qianyi  blamed  the Ming's  \u201cofficial  historians, \u201d \nwho copied  verbatim  \u201cthe words  transmitted  by [Yi] Songgye.\nArmed  with the History  of  the East, Qian brings  to bear an erudition  \nperior  to what the compilers  of the Ming  dynasty \u2019s own \u201cveritable \u201d records  \nhad possessed.  He discounts  the possibility  that Chong  could have plotted  \ninvasion  of Liaodong,  because  he had demonstrated  a commitment  to pursu\u00ad\ning good relations  with the Ming.

Qian  Qianyi  related  a case where  Hongwu  \nrefused  the appeals  for aid from Koryo loyalists  against  the usurping  Yi \nSonggye.  The Ming  ruler  left Koryo  to its own devices,  because  as \u201ca faraway  \nland occupied  by the eastern  barbarians,  it could not be controlled  by the \nCentral  State \u201d (Zhongguo \u4e2d\u570b \uff0ci.e., China).

Ibid.,\n\n317 10 Wang  | Qian Qianyi\nHongwu,  far from ignoring  Yi S6nggye \u2019s usurpation,  kept a  clear  eye on the \nmoral failures  of the Yi house,  reminding  his descendants  in his Ancestral  \nInjunctions  that the Choson  founder  Yi Songgye  had murdered  four of the \nformer  Koryo  rulers.  Qian again  concluded  that the fault was with the \u201coffi- \ncial historians, \u201d who were so \u201cbound  up by their documents, \u201d that they  failed  \nto see the Ming  emperor \u2019s \u201coriginal  intent \u201d and did not make  \u201cproper emen \u00ad\ndations  in their carelessness. \u201d52 In other words,  given the Ming emperor \u2019s \nrecognition  of Yi's crimes,  he would  have aided  these  loyalists,  but now the \nhistorical  records  even misrepresented  the emperor \u2019s intentions.\nQian's efforts  to defend  the Hongwu  emperor  necessarily  raises  \nquestions.  If Qian could praise  a Korean  historian  for exalting  individuals  \nwho resisted  his own dynasty  and allow him the moral legitimacy  to chal\u00ad\nlenge his own rulers,  does that mean  Qian  allowed  himself  a similar  historio \u00ad\ngraphical  space?  Could  he, a Ming  subject,  use history  to challenge  the mon- \narchs  of the dynasty  to whom  he owed  his loyalty?\nQian Qianyi \u2019s treatment  of a poem  by Yi Pangwon  included  in the Col\u00ad\nlected  Poetry  offers a clue. 53 Qian lambasted  Pangwon  for presenting  the \npoem to the Yongle  emperor  to commemorate  the imperial  accession.  The \nYongle  emperor  had acquired  the throne  through  civil war, wresting  control  \nof the dynasty  from his nephew,  the Jianwen  emperor  \u5efa\u6587 \uff08r. 1398-1402).  \nWith this context  in mind,  Qian Qianyi \u2019s reference  to the \u201cleviathan \u201d in the \ncryptic  line \u201cNot yet slain is the leviathan;  spirits  yet run high\u201d \u672a\u622e\u68d8\u98ef\u6c23  \u5c1a\u9846 seems  to be a thinly  veiled  reference  to the Jianwen  emperor.some\n54He con-\n\u81ea\u6d2a\u6b66\u516d\u5e74\u81f3\u4e8c\u5341\u516b\u5e74 \uff0c\u674e\u65e6\u9996\u5c3e\u51e152.

The Yongle  emperor  had justified  his rebellion  as \na means  to eliminate  \u201cevil\u201d ministers  from his nephew \u2019s side. Despite  these  \nlimited  pretensions,  his court  moved  further to expurgate  the entire  Jianwen  \nreign from the historical  record  after he seized  the throne.  Jianwen \u2019s loyal \nministers  who died at the hands  of Yongle  were not exonerated  by the state  \nuntil well into the Wanli  reign \u842c\u66c6 \uff081573-1620).  The eventual  acknowledg \u00ad\nment  of these  martyrs  resulted  from  a process  of accommodation  and conten \u00ad\ntion between  local authority  represented  by the gentry  and dynastic authority  \nembodied  in the ruler. Public  commemoration  of the Jianwen  martyrs  ulti\u00ad\nmately  required  the elision  of Yongle \u2019s role in their deaths.  Thus both Qian  \nand the Korean  compiler  of the History  of the Eastern  Kingdom  shied  away  \nfrom  criticizing  the ancestors  of their  own rulers.  The texts  they wrote  appear  \nto seek a reconciliation  between  royal authority  and those who resisted  it. \nThis form of reconciliation,  however,  did not deny the independent  moral  \nauthority  of historiographical  writing.  Far from it. As Peter  Ditmanson  ar\u00ad\ngues,  the \u201creconciliation  of Yongle  with the dead  martyrs \u201d occurred  on \u201clite-55\n56\nperor  spared  even evil ministers  in a show  of magnanimity.

The fall of the Ming,  however,  altered  the relationship  between  the \ngentry  and the state. In a great historical  irony, the very same literati  who \n\u201ckilled  the Ming \u201d through  partisanship  and resistance  to monarchical  author \u00ad\nity were now, as Harry  Miller  describes  it, \u2018\u2018[dying]  gloriously,  to defend  its \ncorpse \u201d as self-identified  loyalists.  For Qian Qianyi,  who had once found \nhimself  among  those  scholarly  ranks,  the destruction  of the Ming  made  cen- \nof its long-dead  rulers less meaningful,  and counterproductive  to the \nproject  of commemoration.

To illustrate  this point, Qian could not have critiqued  the Ming \nVeritable  Records  without  having  had access  to them  in the first place.

The Ming  envoy  \nwho proclaimed  this edict  was the last one ever  to set foot on Korean  soil. One \nmonth  after  his departure,  Hong  Taiji invaded  Choson,  and permanently  sev\u00ad\nered the Ming  court  from its former  tributary  state and military  ally.\nIt was no wonder  then that tears flowed  from his eyes when  Qian  remem \u00ad\nbered his earlier  poem.  Its closing  lines had warned  that it would  be too late \nfor regrets  once the \u201ccaitiff  hordes \u201d were  at the gates,  and now, with his warn \u00ad\nings unheeded,  the Ming  empire  lay in ruins.  The poem  thus connected  the \nKorean  anthology  to what Qian considered  to have been the unfolding  of a \nhistorical  tragedy.  During  the Imjin  War the Ming  had saved  Choson  from  the \nJapanese,  but now, as the Ming  faced its own existential  crisis,  Choson  was \nunable  to come  to its defense  or even safeguard  itself  from the Manchu  incur \u00ad\nsions.  In retrospect,  the loss of Choson  as a vassal  forewarned  the Ming \u2019s own \neventual  demise.\nThe fall of Choson  Korea,  long imagined  as China \u2019s (and thus the Ming \u2019s) \nmost loyal vassal,  now seemed  likely  to become  a synecdoche  for the Ming  as \na whole.  The entire story of the dynasty \u2019s waxing  and waning  \npressed  into one charged  kernel,  Korea,  and anything  associated  with that \nkernel  would  remind\nhappened,  Qian came across another  book in his collection,  a fifteenth-  \ncentury  Korean  edition  of Liu Zongyuan \u2019s \u67f3\u5b97\u5143 (773-819)  collected  works  \nthat did exactly  that.

One might  say \nthey were  tangible  evidence  of the Ming \u2019s literary  and cultural  influence;  they \nwere included  as paraphernalia  to honor  the Ming, not as objects  of honor  \nthemselves.  Even if one were to take this dismissive  view of these  poets  and \ninsist  on the marginality  of Korea  in the consciousness  of late Ming literati,  \nthe vivid associations  of Korea,  as a symbol  of culture  and loyalty,  evoked  in \nthe late Ming cannot  be discounted.

If writing  about  others  means  claiming  the power  \ngive meaning  to their lives, then biographers  have to write against  those  \nfrom the past who already  made  claims  about  them and they must  anticipate  \nthe contentions  of challengers  in the future.

It is an anonymous work\nwritten to celebrate a wedding arranged by King Ch \u014fngjo. Called Story of the East-\nern Chamber , the play evokes not only the Chinese Story of the Western Chamber\nthrough titular reference but also the Chinese vernacular tradition as a whole. Writ-ten entirely in Chinese characters, the text weaves vernacular Korean words into thesyntax of Chinese baihua vernacular, an unusual form which upsets the conventional\ndiglossic binary of literary Chinese ( hanmun ) and vernacular Korean ( hang \u016dl). This\nessay situates the text in a late Chos \u014fn discourse of linguistic difference marked by\npronounced anxieties about the temporal and spatial contingency of language. Somelate Chos \u014fn writers, including the text \u2019s putative author, Yi Ok, embraced difference\nto carve out a localized literary space in Chos \u014fn Korea. For King Ch \u014fngjo, it threat-\nened the textual foundation of royal authority. Eastern Chamber spoke to these dilem-\nmas by imagining a linguistic space where vernacular Korean usage could be rep-resented as a literary language in the Chinese script, reconciling kingly authoritywith local speci \ufb01city.\nKeywords: diglossia; vernacular; late Chos \u014fn; Yi Ok; King Ch \u014fngjo\nKorea \u2019s earliest extant playscript, and one of only three written entirely in sino-\ngraphs (i.e., Chinese characters, hanja\u6f22\u5b57),1Tongsanggi \u6771\u5ec2\u8a18/\u6771\u5e8a\u8a18(Story\nof the Eastern Chamber ), is a text of many contradictions.

Its story celebrates virtuous kingship, possibly written\nto curry royal favor, but it \ufb02outed the very linguistic order espoused by the king.\nAt stake was not simply linguistic conven tion, but the literary orthodoxies at\nthe basis of royal assertions of authority at the Chos \u014fn court under King Ch \u014fngjo\n\u6b63\u7956(r. 1776 \u20131800).

In a show of royal muni \ufb01cence, the court opened its own coffers\nand storehouses to sponsor their rites.4According to Tongsanggi \u2019s preface, news of\nthese unusual events broke the spell of idleness suffered by its author. The weariness\nof\u201cancient prose and poetry \u201dand his usual sopori \ufb01c reading material had left him\naimless and apprehensive, but the marriage of Kim H \u016dijip inspired him to try his\nhand at a new form, a \u201cplay\u201d(k\u016dk\u5287).\nThe play tells its story in four acts. The \ufb01rst act introduces us to the unwed and\nchildless Kim H \u016dijip. Kim spends the bulk of the act bemoaning his poverty, his\nadvanced age of thirty, and his dim prospects of \ufb01nding a spouse. His lamenta-\ntions are interrupted by a government functionary who arrives to demand his\nname, place of ancestry, and age \u2014information to be added to a register of bach-\nelors and spinsters in preparation for a series of government-arranged weddings.5\nThe second act turns to two state functionaries charged with these weddings. To-gether, they sing the praises of the reigning king, extolling the royal sponsorshipof these weddings as yet one more of his grand accomplishments. They inves-\ntigate the register of the unwed and discover Kim H \u016dijip, as well as a twenty-four-\nyear-old Lady Sin. They verify their astrological compatibility ( saju\n\u56db\u67f1)a n da\nmatch is made. In the third act, a functionary of the Board of Personnel describes\nthe preparations for their wedding. In the meantime, ritual implements, marriage\ncostumes, wedding gifts, and banquet victuals arrive from various governmentof\ufb01ces, showcasing the material and ceremonial splendor of a court-sponsored\nwedding. In the fourth and \ufb01nal act, the of \ufb01cials pay the now married Kim a visit.\nThey proceed to amuse themselves at Kim \u2019s expense, placing him under a mock\njudicial interrogation in which Kim H \u016dijip is forced to \u201cconfess \u201dthe circumstances\nof his wedding. Once his confession is complete, Kim is reminded of the magni-\ntude of the royal favor he has received and is released. Kim orders his attendant toprepare \ufb01ne wine for his guests. They drink a series of toasts honoring the king and\nthe heir apparent, ending the play.\nThe immediate backdrop of Tongsanggi is clear, but locating the text within\nbroader cultural, literary, and historical contexts is another matter. For one,30 Sixiang Wang\nthere is the outstanding question of authorship.

In the 1780s and 1790s, King\nCh\u014fngjo enacted a series of policies on literary style, dubbed the literary recti \ufb01cation\n(munch \u2019e panj \u014fng\u6587\u9ad4\u53cd\u6b63) movement by modern scholars.10Decrying the in \ufb02u-\nence of late Ming and early Qing popular \ufb01ction and literati prose, he targeted in\nparticular Korean writers of a genre of literary vignettes, which he called the sop\u2019um\n(literally \u201cminor works \u201d[Ch. xiaopin\u5c0f\u54c1]).11In 1792, he ordered these writers,\nwho included Yi T \u014fngmu, to compose essays of self-criticism ( chasongmun\n\u81ea\u8a1f\u6587) forswearing this deviant style.12Among Ch \u014fngjo\u2019so t h e rv i c t i m sw a sY i\nOk, who, lacking strong political connections, arguably suffered the most for hisinfractions. In 1796, Ch \u014fngjo discovered Yi Ok had passed a preliminary civil ser-\nvice exam, but disquali \ufb01ed him for writing in the despised sop\u2019umstyle.\n13He was\nexiled as punishment and never returned to take another exam, foreclosing thepotential for an active political life.\n14\nNo historical record identi \ufb01es which of Yi Ok \u2019s works Ch \u014fngjo found so dis-\ntasteful. If Yi Ok is indeed its author, Tongsanggi would certainly be a candidate.\nAt the time of Kim H \u016dijip\u2019s wedding, Yi Ok was a student at the National Acad-\nemy. It was therefore possible that a piece commemorating the event would have\ncome to the king \u2019s attention. If so, the king would have balked at its use of ver-\nnacular written Chinese, which the king had \u201cbranded as heretic[al] \u201delsewhere,\nfor instance in Pak Chiw \u014fn\u2019s\u6734\u8dbe\u6e90(1737 \u20131805) Jehol Diary (Y\u014frha ilgi\u71b1\u6cb3\u65e5\n\u8a18).15The question remains, however: why was the king so concerned with liter-\nary style in the \ufb01rst place?\nIn his literary proscriptions, Ch \u014fngjo lumped deviant Ming-Qing prose together\nwith religious heterodoxy, namely Catholic doctrines and Buddhist texts.

Its celebration of marital mores and eulogy\nto kingship seems to shore up orthodoxy, not harm it. Deviance was therefore not\nreducible to a text \u2019s content but was inherent to its very form. The king reserved\nhis greatest vitriol for deviant literary styles, insisting they \u201cposed a threat even\ngreater than heterodox learning. \u201d18\nThe intimate link between form and ideology then raises the question: what pre-\ncisely can \u201cimproper \u201dform do? If \u201cproper \u201dform shored up orthodoxy, and het-\nerodoxy is by de \ufb01nition what orthodoxy excludes, then understanding deviant lit-\nerary styles in terms of their impropriety can tell us what they undermined, but notwhat they sought to create. What needs to be understood instead is how the form\nofTongsanggi relates to the moral and political stakes surrounding language and\nliterary style in the late Chos \u014fn. Focusing on form, to be sure, cannot settle the\nquestion of authorship, but does free us from relying on a biographical anchor to\nprovide contextualization. How Tongsanggi \ufb01t into its putative author \u2019s life be-\ncomes less critical once our attention shifts to what the form of the text says\nabout how language, writing, politics, and morality related to each other.\nThe potential of form in Tongsanggi hinges on the stability (and plasticity) of\nthe\u201ccharacter, \u201dthe sinograph (\n\u5b57), as a reference for meaning. For one, Tong-\nsanggi connects script and language in a manner that demands us to rethink\nour understanding of late Chos \u014fn linguistic space. In a conventional diglossic\nmodel, literary Sinitic and vernacular K orean represent two distinct linguistic\nzones onto which value-laden binaries of \u201ccosmopolitan \u201dand\u201clocal, \u201d\u201chigh\u201d\nand\u201clow,\u201dare mapped.

More productive, instead, is to embrace Tongsanggi \u2019sl i n g u i s t i c\nidiosyncrasies as a case study in what Si Nae Park and Ross King have called the\n\u201cecology \u201dof Chos \u014fn linguistic practice.20\nThese linguistic idiosyncrasies, which boil down to whether sinographs are\nused as calques or rebuses, that is for semantic or phonetic reference, challenge\nthe privileged position of literary Sinitic as the authoritative paradigm for the\nscript \u2019s use. Divesting the sinograph of putatively intrinsic meaning threatened\nKing Ch \u014fngjo\u2019s literary and political vision, where royal authority was expressed\nby enforcing orthodoxies whose very possibility required consistent and author-\nitative interpretation of the classical past. Tongsanggi ,h o w e v e r ,a l s op r o v i d e sa\nrebuttal to this potential objection. It sought to reconcile the moral prerogatives32 Sixiang Wang\nof the Confucian kingship with cultural speci \ufb01city, local difference, and historical\nchange. The Korean king could remain a steward of Confucian civilization, but\nrather than depend on the authority of tradition, he drew his legitimacy from theimmediacy of the present and the local \u2014a turn to a vernacular vision of political\nauthority.\nTHE LANGUAGE OF THE TONGSANGGI : BEYOND DIGLOSSIA\nThe question of form connects the use of language with matters of genre and style.\nAt\ufb01rst glance, Tongsanggi is a play, incorporating aural and dramaturgical ele-\nments that hint at the potential for performance. The text, however, undercutsthat possibility; its admixture of multipl e linguistic registers leaves the identity\nof the language it represents ambiguous. This interdeterminacy upends the ready\noverlap between vocalization and text re \ufb02ected in the modernist conceit of\n\u014fnmun ilch \u2019i. But if we dispense with this conceit, then the question of how\nsound relates to the text guides us not toward the identity of the represented lan-\nguage but to something more fundamental about the culture of language and itsdiscourse in premodern Korea.\nTongsanggi \u2019s preface, already reticent about authorship, implored the reader to\nrefrain from inquiring into \u201cthe text \u2019s form and style \u201d(\n\u6587\u4e4b\u70ba\u4f55\u9ad4\u88c1).21Never-\ntheless, the Chinese Story of the Western Chamber stands out as its most obvious\ninspiration,22a connection alluded to in the play \u2019s introductory poem:\nPoverty af \ufb02icts him greatly; he sighs humbly in the southern quarter;\nThe ministers preside over a wedding by the western wall.An aging maiden hears of this affair by the northern gates;A good husband and wife render thanks for blessings of the eastern bed ( tongsang", "doc_id": "15a4df0e-6692-486f-85a2-59098104a11f", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "526d40f99e63e2abad426d9de966b59c3343eeaaa7ab0baad031caf789d81697", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 12537, "end": 15878}, "relationships": {"1": "c73f8cc6-41dc-4c56-9792-e0f948eba269", "2": "2fb20615-bac9-4fcf-9dd1-eb3e7681b7fb", "3": "0e0e1741-67dd-40f7-bc8b-de43cb45d07d"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "0e0e1741-67dd-40f7-bc8b-de43cb45d07d": {"__data__": {"text": "something more fundamental about the culture of language and itsdiscourse in premodern Korea.\nTongsanggi \u2019s preface, already reticent about authorship, implored the reader to\nrefrain from inquiring into \u201cthe text \u2019s form and style \u201d(\n\u6587\u4e4b\u70ba\u4f55\u9ad4\u88c1).21Never-\ntheless, the Chinese Story of the Western Chamber stands out as its most obvious\ninspiration,22a connection alluded to in the play \u2019s introductory poem:\nPoverty af \ufb02icts him greatly; he sighs humbly in the southern quarter;\nThe ministers preside over a wedding by the western wall.An aging maiden hears of this affair by the northern gates;A good husband and wife render thanks for blessings of the eastern bed ( tongsang ).\n\u7aae\u63aa\u5927\u5357\u6d1e\u7aca\u6b4e\n\u8af8\u5c1a\u66f8\u897f\u57ce\u4e3b\u5a5a\n\u8001\u8655\u5973\u5317\u95dc\u5fb9\u805e\n\u597d\u592b\u5a66\u6771\u5e8a\u611f\u606923\nThe Korean reading of \u201ceastern bed \u201d(Ch. dongchuang \u6771\u5e8a)a stongsang, homoph-\nonous with \u201ceastern chamber \u201d(Ch. dongxiang \u6771\u5ec2), provides the play with its most\nwell-known title, Story of the Eastern Chamber , and points to the piece \u2019s matri-\nmonial themes.24A number of paratextual references to Western Chamber , though\nlikely later insertions, reinforce this association.25\nWe also see parallels with Western Chamber in the form of Tongsanggi. The\nintroductory poem mentioned above functions as the zhengmu \u6b63\u76ee, a feature\npresent in the Western Chamber and prevalent in Chinese Yuan period (1271 \u2013\n1368) zaju\u96dc\u5287, whose dramaturgical conventions Tongsanggi appropriates.26\nAmong these are the indication of stage directions and acting cues ( ke\u79d1).\nNew personages27are introduced with a self-introduction in the form of a quatrainStory of the Eastern Chamber 33\nor couplet (i.e. Ch. shangchang shi\u4e0a\u5834\u8a69).28As in zaju, the protagonists \u2019lines\nalternate between aria (Ch. chang\u5531) and recitative segments (Ch. bai\u767d), which\nare in turn organized in song suites (Ch. qupai\u66f2\u724c).29\nIn keeping with the zaju\u2019slinguistic conventions, Tongsanggi employs a ver-\nnacular register of written Chinese, especially in its recitative sections. A literate\nChos \u014fn Korean audience would have recognized the characters \u4e86,\u7684, and\u9ebd\nsprinkled throughout the text as grammatical elements drawn from the vernacular\nregister of Chinese, for they appeared frequently in Chinese popular \ufb01ction and\nthe exegetical texts of Song Confucians, even if they seldom appeared in Koreansinographic compositions.\n30\nThe proximity of Tongsanggi \u2019s language to vernacular written Chinese, how-\never, is deceptive.

In some cases, these stage\ndirections were even completely omitted.46\nLiterate Koreans familiar with Chinese popular literature could understand the\nplay as text. But that does not make the questions of vocalization and aural com-prehension irrelevant. After all, Tongsanggi makes explicit use of dramaturgical\nconventions, while its cons picuous admixture of Korean and Chinese vernacu-\nlar registers invokes the possibility of or ality. When a set of Chinese characters\npointed to a Korean expression, would th e hypothetical actor have said the lines\nusing a native Korean word in its place, or should he have rendered the char-\nacters in contemporary Sino-Korean p ronunciation? What about a vernacular\nChinese expression?\nIn some respects, these issues are inherent to the sinographic script \u2019s (Kr. muncha\n\u6587\u5b57) relationship with spoken language. Logographic rather than phonographic,\na string of sinographs possesses a fundamental \u201cplasticity as a read sign\u201dthat\naccommodates distinct regional and national traditions of enunciation (as well\nas different conventions across time); there is no fundamentally \u201cauthentic \u201dor\n\u201ccorrect \u201dway of speaking a written text.47Therefore, no particular language is\ninherent in the script itself; accessing language from text depends on a set of her-\nmeneutic conventions, such as syntactical analysis via Japanese kundoku \u8a13\u8b80and\nKorean t\u2019o\u5410, combined with regular phonological rules, to create meaning,36 Sixiang Wang\nassign sounds, and enable enunciation.48The possibility of language in the text\ndepends on established practices and authoritative traditions for mapping visual\nsigns to aural and semantic referents.49In the case of Tongsanggi , a regime of\nvocalization is suggested only in one late edition of the text, printed in 1918.\nThis version employs the t\u2019osystem, which appends syntactical elements in\nthe Korean alphabet to the original sinographic text. This technique, however,is absent in the text \u2019s earlier renditions.\n50\nThe dif \ufb01culties a text such as Tongsanggi presents for analysis are in many re-\nspects an artifact of conventional understandings of Chos \u014fn linguistic space as\n\u201cdiglossic \u201d\u2014that is to say, where the cosmopolitan written language of literary\nSinitic was conceived as diametrically opposed to Korean oral traditions and writ-\ning in vernacular Korean script.51The standard diglossic model divides linguistic\npractices according to a series of binaries in: script (Sinoscript vs. Korean alpha-\nbet), register (cosmopolitan vs. vernacular), gender (male vs. female), and \ufb01nally,\nspace and audience (public vs. private).

The binary categories in the Chos \u014fn discourse of lan-\nguage are only vaguely diglossic in how they sort different registers of language\naccording to social and moral value. For instance, writing in the Korean alphabet\nwas referred to as \u014fnmun\u8afa\u6587(vernacular writing) or \u014fncha\u8afa\u5b57(vernacular\nscript), which was counterposed to writing in literary Sinitic (Kr. muncha \u6587\n\u5b57). The term \u014fn\u8afaindexed a register of the spoken or the local; though usually\ntranslated as \u201cvernacular, \u201dit may better approximate the sense of \u201ccolloquial. \u201d\nKorean words, even if rendered in sinographs, and not the Korean alphabet,\ncould still be referred to as i\u014fn\u4fda\u8afa(colloquialism). \u201cLocal \u201d(hyang\u9109ort\u2019o\n\u571f) deviations from the \u201cstandard \u201d(Kr. ch\u014fng, Ch. zheng\u6b63) or the \u201celegant \u201d\n(Kr.a, Ch. ya\u96c5),\ufb01t under the rubric of sok\u4fd7(Ch. su), the \u201cvulgar \u201dor the \u201cver-\nnacular. \u201dNot exclusive to language, the category of sokencompassed many\nsenses of the local, referring to Korean habits as well as Chinese customs.These binaries therefore do not correspond to diglossic categories or even describe\na diglossic linguistic situation.\nWhen these emic pairings are examined in toto ,instead of as individual\npairs, what emerges is an understanding of language that is typologically multi-\ndimensional.

It also collapses the distance between them by treating their differ-\nences as incremental rather t han fundamental. The language of Tongsanggi, by\nusing written vernacular Chinese forms as a vehicle for Korean vernacular expres-\nsion, results in what Yun Chiyang describes as an unprecedented and experimental\n\u201cKorean baihua .\u201dIt was a constructed vernacular register where the lexicon of the\nKorean everyday was embedded in the syntax of vernacular written Chinese.\n53\nRather than a hybrid of \u201cChinese \u201dwith \u201cKorean \u201delements, it was a vernacular\nregister of sinographic writing that textualized Korean as a new type of Sinitic\nvernacular.\nFigure 1. Diglossic model: distance between Korean and Chinese Vernaculars mediated by literary\nSinitic38 Sixiang Wang\nHerein lies the signi \ufb01cance of employing the literary and cosmopolitan sino-\ngraphic script, instead of the \u201cvernacular \u201d(Korean) script. Whatever its in \ufb02ections\nof local speci \ufb01city, Tongsanggi remained within a textual ecumene based on the\n\u201csame script \u201d(Kr.tongmun , Ch. tongwen \u540c\u6587). Following a similar logic to idu\nwriting in Korea and Ch \u1eefN\u00f4m\u5357in Vietnam (with the exception that Tong-\nsanggi did not create new graphs, and thus remained potentially legible to a Chi-\nnese audience), the usage in Tongsanggi was conceived as but one more variant of\n(and therefore compatible with) a universal standard.54\nThe language of Tongsanggi provides for something akin to a written Sino-\nKorean cosmopolitan vernacular. It was a mode of writing that maintained tex-tual interoperability between Korean and Chinese vernacular sp aces, rendering\nthe difference between \u201cChinese \u201dand\u201cKorean \u201da moot point, since in theory all\nvernacular variations could be accommo dated with a common script.

With\ncolloquial expressions transposed from another space and time, Tongsanggi\nimagined a Korea where the spoken language followed the syntax of Yuan-\nperiod Mandarin, sprinkled with cont emporary Korean words. Its text was non-\nlocal because it referenced conventions of speech, diction, and syntax that\nultimately belonged to nowhere, and thus forwent the power of circumscribing\na local space, an advantage normally accorded to a vernacular. Yet, its conven-tions also appear unsuited for a cosmopolitan language. It belongs to no one lo-\ncale, but it also depends on local legibility to be comprehensible, jeopardizing its\nability to transmit across wider cultural zones.\nDespite these apparent handicaps, this experimental cosmopolitan vernacular\nhad more potential than it would \ufb01rst appear.

Though u ltimately a path not taken, its linguistic experiment\nwas not, in fact, an obvious dead end at the time, for it commented on distinctly\neighteenth-century concerns: the anxiet ies spurred by an awareness of growing\ncultural and linguistic distance from both Chos \u014fn Korea \u2019s classical roots and their\ncommon heirs in China. Against these anxieties, it will become clear why it was\ndesirable for one written language to simultaneously accommodate both vernacular\ndifference and cross the distance such difference created.\nDISCOURSES OF \u201cVERNACULAR \u201dIN EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY\nCHOS \u014eN KOREA\nDuring the late eighteenth century, Chos \u014fn writers, including Tongsanggi \u2019s puta-\ntive author, Yi Ok, often wrote self-consciously about how language was bound to\ntime, location, and social level.

For Hong\nTaeyong, differences between Korean practice, classical usage, and contemporary\nChinese convention provided him an opportunity to demonstrate a Korean \u2019s supe-\nrior grasp of standards of prosody. In a letter to a Chinese friend, Hong pointed out\na faulty rhyme in one of this friend \u2019s poems, a mistake committed because he\nfailed to grasp the difference between contemporary Mandarin pronunciationand the canons of classical phonology. Hong explained he caught the error be-\ncause the Korean alphabet could accurately notate individual phonemes, corre-\nsponding to absolute sounds. Boasting that Korean knowledge was thereforeimpervious to erosion over time, he implied Korean knowledge of Sinitic phonol-\nogy was a more authoritative guide than contemporary Chinese speech.\n60\nSound and speech also highlighted the disjunction between cultural literacy and\nthe ability to communicate that translated to other arenas of cultural activity. Ko-\nrean travelers struggled to understand the lines spoken and sung during perfor-\nmances of popular drama.61These visitors, though estranged from the oral imme-\ndiacy of the theatrical performance, remained keen consumers of its cultural\nrepertoires.62Pak Saho \u6734\u601d\u6d69(1784 \u2013?), who visited Beijing in 1828, did not\nunderstand the speech, but could nonetheless recognize the historical \ufb01gures, cul-\ntural references, and literary signi \ufb01cance of the plays he saw.63Remarking on how\nthe actors \u2019garb, \u201cimitates the dress of the various ages, \u201d64he echoed the obser-\nvations of Pak Chega \u6734\u9f4a\u5bb6(1750 \u20131815) several decades earlier, who expressed\nhis admiration for the Ming-style dress in the costumes of popular theater.

Not even the music of popular theater could escape the ravages of time:\nin their words, the once popular Story of the Western Chamber \u201clulled one toStory of the Eastern Chamber 41\nsleep, \u201dwhile the newer Peony Pavilion \u201cpiqued one \u2019s desire to listen. \u201d68If change\nwas inevitable, how should they, as heirs of the classical past living in the present,\nrecover immutable models from the long arc of time?\nThe contours of this problem had long been a source of controversy in Chos \u014fn.\nThe anxieties surrounding local difference and cultural divergence were, for in-\nstance, articulated at the very outset of the Korean alphabet \u2019s invention. When\nKing Sejong\u4e16\u5b97(r. 1418 \u201350) promulgated the Korean alphabet in 1443, cour-\ntiers such as Ch \u2019oe Malli \u5d14\u842c\u7406(?\u20131445) accused the king of forsaking a com-\nmon civilized script ( tongmun \u540c\u6587).69Ultimately, the king and Ch \u2019oe\u2019s disagree-\nments over the value of the new alphabet arose from shared concerns: that\ndivergent cultural and linguistic evolution in Korea and China threatened cultural\ncleavage from the classical foundations of a civilized order.70King Sejong envi-\nsioned the alphabet as a tool to \u201ccorrect the sounds, \u201da useful technology for pre-\nserving linguistic stability and a solution to the problem of temporal and spatial\ndistance.71In contrast, Ch \u2019oe saw it as a mediator that disrupted Korea \u2019s ability to\ninterface with the universals of Confucian civilization. For him, the Korean alpha-\nbet followed the footsteps of \u201cbarbarians like the Tanguts, Mongols, and Japa-\nnese, \u201dwhile he advocated \u201cChinese \u201dways as the only sure method to preserve\nlinks to the classical past. But could Ch \u2019oe\u2019s logic still hold in the eighteenth cen-\ntury, when the Chinese, too, seemed to have abandoned classical models in favor\nof the vernacular, the fashionable, and the local?\nFor all their acrimony, Ch \u2019oe Malli and King Sejong also indulged a common\nconceit about the sinograph \u2014the belief that it possessed an intrinsic meaning tied\nto\u201ccorrect \u201dsound values.

Unlike Koreans, who had to rely on the\nmediation of Korean script explications ( \u014fnhae\u8afa\u89e3) to comprehend \u201cliterary\nlanguage, \u201dthe Chinese had the advantage of using the lexical repertoire of the\nliterary language in their daily sp eech.72He gave the example of the character\n\u201cheaven \u201d(Kr. ch\u2019\u014fn,C h . tian\u5929). Whereas Koreans referred to heaven as han\u016dl\nin their everyday speech, but ch\u2019\u014fnwhen represented in writing, the Chinese\nused the same word in both spoken language and text. Proximity meant that\neven uneducated Chinese might inadvertently blurt out sentences in the dictionand syntax of the classics. Koreans, on the other hand, pored over books for\nmany more years and yet \u201clagged far behind the Chinese. \u201dThe only way out,\nPak argued, was for Koreans to abandon the use of their native language andadopt spoken Chinese in daily life.\n73This not-so-modest proposal spoke to the\ntensions that emerge when linguistic difference interferes with a cultural identi-\n\ufb01cation based on a cosmopolitan written, literary language. Pak \u2019s proposal strained\nto solve this conundrum by erasing linguistic difference altogether.42 Sixiang Wang\nAt\ufb01rst blush, Tongsanggi seems to actualize Pak \u2019s radical vision, albeit only in\nthe imagined space of text. The denizens of this literary depiction of an imagined\nKorea shift seamlessly from vernacular Chinese to the highly literary register of itsarias. But while Pak Chega valued spoken language as a mediator for accessing\nthe semantics, syntax, and phonology of the classics, Tongsanggi detaches the si-\nnograph from classical diction through its liberal mixture of rebuses and phono-grams. The displacement of classical models echoed more closely Yi Ok \u2019s defense\nof vernacular, local, and spoken linguistic forms in his essay \u201cOn the Colloquial\nand the Vernacular. \u201d\n74\nIn this essay, Yi Ok follows a line of argumentation elevating Korean vernac-\nular into a literary register worthy of written Sinitic. Yi Ok \ufb01rst advances a sense of\nnominal relativism, demolishing the notion that objects have an inherent, originallabel. In a very Zhuangzian statement, he writes, \u201cI cannot know whether what oth-\ners name something is truly its name; [neither] can I know whether what I name it is\nreally its name. \u201d\n75Neither Korean, nor Chinese, nor classical names for things were\n\u201cthe names of \ufb01cially decreed by [the god] Pan Gu \u201dafter he created the universe by\nsplitting heaven and earth, so there was no reason to privilege ancient or contem-\nporary Chinese usages over Korean ones.76That the Koreans called paper cho[ng]-i\n\u7167\u610f(a phonogram for the vernacular Korean word for paper), while the Chinese\ncalled paper zhi\u7d19, owed to time and place alone, for \u201cthey called things whatever\nthey had named them; [just as] we call things whatever we named them. \u201d77Seen\nfrom Yi Ok \u2019s", "doc_id": "84516016-f594-4b6a-9475-82d914379bf9", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "f14be51fc2570edd4a50bf798055f73e1c4608e11bcffebb5f8c6c3e73fce341", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 48579, "end": 51988}, "relationships": {"1": "c73f8cc6-41dc-4c56-9792-e0f948eba269", "2": "8d94c23d-f867-454d-8d2b-85685dffcdf4", "3": "6745da45-9223-4941-aebc-20ceca3b2350"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "6745da45-9223-4941-aebc-20ceca3b2350": {"__data__": {"text": "what oth-\ners name something is truly its name; [neither] can I know whether what I name it is\nreally its name. \u201d\n75Neither Korean, nor Chinese, nor classical names for things were\n\u201cthe names of \ufb01cially decreed by [the god] Pan Gu \u201dafter he created the universe by\nsplitting heaven and earth, so there was no reason to privilege ancient or contem-\nporary Chinese usages over Korean ones.76That the Koreans called paper cho[ng]-i\n\u7167\u610f(a phonogram for the vernacular Korean word for paper), while the Chinese\ncalled paper zhi\u7d19, owed to time and place alone, for \u201cthey called things whatever\nthey had named them; [just as] we call things whatever we named them. \u201d77Seen\nfrom Yi Ok \u2019s perspective, the hybrid uses of the sinograph in Tongsanggi were\nno more than one possible convention out of many and anticipated, for instance\nthe even more radical poetry of Kim Satkat \u91d1\uc0bf\uac13(1807 \u201363), which not only\nmade creative use of Korean lexica in the form of puns and double entendres,\nbut also incorporated colloquial Korean syntax and grammar into the form of clas-\nsical poetry.78\nTo unmoor the sinograph from the meanings and readings of the classics was to\ntreat it as a \ufb02exible technology rather than a source of authority. Yi does not cast\nthis move as a radical departure, but appeals to hoary, if archaic, traditions inKorea. Venerable \ufb01gures like the Kory \u014fhistorian Kim Pusik\n\u91d1\u5bcc\u8efe(1075 \u2013\n1151) and the monk scholar Iry \u014fn\u4e00\u7136(1206 \u201389) had after all employed sino-\ngraphs to represent Korean words.79They had done so, Yi argues, out of necessity.\nSome entities, known only by \u201clocal sounds \u201dand\u201cunnamed by literary characters\n[i.e., sinographs], \u201dgive the writer no choice but to invent new character com-\npounds.80The author otherwise risks absurdity. One Korean poet once referred\nto a local bird not by its Korean name, but as a pichwi\u7fe1\u7fe0 (Ch. feicui ), the king-\n\ufb01sher of classical literature, simply because it, too, had green feathers. The result-\ning line, \u201camid \ufb02ourishing bamboo by a village abode, the king \ufb01sher cries, \u201dcre-\nates an incongruity, where a bird from the tropics of southeast Asia \u201cnow perched\nin a Chos \u014fn villager \u2019s home. \u201d81\nLike his contemporaries, Yi Ok addressed the problem of how local speci \ufb01city\nand temporal change could be reconciled with universal cultural horizons.

The burden of carrying Korea \u2019s linguis-\ntic difference and local color fell entirely on sinographs.

What did Tongsanggi speci\ufb01cally\nhave to say regarding late Chos \u014fn politics of language and the communicability of\nthe local with the universal? One crucial feature of Tongsanggi , which has been\nhitherto neglected, is its treatment of the civilizing mission of Korean kingship. Its\npanegyrics to kingship, along with how it dialogues with its literary antecedents,\nlink linguistic innovation to questions of political authority, which was ultimatelywhat was at stake for King Ch \u014fngjo in his literary campaigns. Tongsanggi, as did\nCh\u014fngjo, envisioned an intimate connection between language and authority, but\none with important distinctions from what the king espoused.\nKing Ch \u014fngjo was hardly alone in identifying imported Chinese texts as the\nprimary vector for moral corruption.\n92Yi T \u014fngmu, an avid consumer of these\ntexts, once cast Western Chamber as the moral antithesis to the classics. In a letter\nto his friend Pak Chega, who was then bedridden with illness, Yi warned that recov-\nery demanded the \u201cpurgation of the heart and the calming of the spirit. \u201dPak\u2019sd a i l y\nperusal of Western Chamber , with its stimulating scenes of romantic love and thinly\nveiled depictions of sex, would only make his illness worse. In jest, Yi urged Pak to\n\u201cuse [his] brush to slay \u201dthe text \u2019s redactor Jin Shengtan \u91d1\u8056\u6b4e(1608 \u201361) and\n\u201cburn his books by his own hand. \u201dFor an antidote, Pak should then instead recite\ntheAnalects every day to effect a speedy recovery.93\nThere are formal and thematic parallels between Western Chamber andTong-\nsanggi, but they offer vastly different resolutions to the problem of gender disor-\nder. In Western Chamber , the male protagonist, Zhang Junrui \u5f35\u541b\u745e, violates\ngendered boundaries to pursue a premarital romance with his betrothed, Cui Yin-\ngying\u5d14\u9daf\u9daf. Their premature consummation jeopardizes their eventual union as\na married couple when Cui Yingying \u2019s mother discovers their trysts. She allows\nthem to marry under the condition that Zhang redeem himself by passing the civil\nservice exams. Zhang is successful and the eventual marriage retroactively sanc-ti\ufb01es their illicit romance. Tongsanggi takes no such detour.

Consider the following aria:\nIn the bright snow of the winter moon, someone cannot bear the cold.\nThe autumn \ufb02ower may have allure, but with spring gone, who would call it\nbeautiful?\nThis cluster of fragrant sorrow bloats one to death.Even without asking, one already knows that a silkworm once old can still spin a\ncocoon,\nA\ufb02ower once old can still bear pollen, but a virgin once old \u2014what is she to do?\n\u51ac\u6708\u660e\u96ea\u88cf\u4eba\u5acc\u51b7\n\u79cb\u82b1\u598d\u6625\u53bb\u8ab0\u7a31\u7f8e\n\u4e00\u53e2\u9999\u6101\u4ee4\u4eba\u8139\u6b7b\n\u4e0d\u554f\u53ef\u77e5\u8836\u8001\u4e86\u7336\u80fd\u5ba4\n\u82b1\u8001\u4e86\u5c1a\u80fd\u5b50\u8655\u5973\u8001\u4e86\u5948\u4f55\u723e.96\nHere, the of \ufb01cial charged with planning the wedding speaks through the tropes\nof youth and beauty wasted, themes reminiscent of a standard boudoir lament\n(Kr.kyuw\u014fn,C h . guiyuan \u95a8\u6028).

The royal reg-ulation of marriage rites, once critical to Korea \u2019s\u201cConfucian \u201dsocial transforma-\ntion, remained a core expression of its civilizing mission.\n100InTongsanggi , royal\nsponsorship of marriage is compared to other instances of royal activism. In the46 Sixiang Wang\nsecond act of the play, an of \ufb01cial extols the \u201ccountless great and virtuous deeds\naccomplished by the state. \u201d101He praises how the king \u201ccared for and nurtured the\npeople \u201dby opening granaries during a famine as parallel examples of \u201cthe king \u2019s\nbene\ufb01cence. \u201d102These royal acts not only rescued the \u201ccommon people of the\nnorthern provinces, \u201d103but also saved Kim H \u016dijip from never \u201cknowing what\nit is like to have in-laws \u201deven after \u201chis hair has turned white as Chinese\nsilk.\u201d104Treating these two acts in the same vein resonates with a Mencian\nview of benevolent government. One passage in Mencius recounts how Mencius\nexplained to King Hui of Liang that sexual desire in and of itself brings no harm tothe ruler, so long as \u201cthere were no spurned women or unmarried men \u201din the\nkingdom. What mattered was that \u201cthe common people [enjoy] what the king de-\nlights in. \u201dIn subsequent passages, ful \ufb01llment of sexual desire through the regu-\nlation of marriage becomes analogous to providing for the livelihood of the com-\nmon people in a broader program of benevolent kingship where both the material\nand psychological needs of the people were paramount priorities.\n105Encouraging\nmarriage ensured the king \u2019s subjects could satisfy their natural human desires\nwithout violating propriety.106\nThis vision of a benevolent and activist kingship converges with both Ch \u014fng-\njo\u2019s views of the monarch \u2019s role in governance and his literary policies.107As\nscholar An Taehoe has argued, it is inadequate to construe Ch \u014fngjo\u2019s literary rec-\nti\ufb01cation campaign simply as the convulsions of a conservative king, afraid of\nnovel and foreign ideas.

Reinforcing orthodoxy here wasmeant to ensure \u201cthe continuity of knowledge \u201dwith the classical past, a continuity\nthreatened, as Gregory Evon argues, by linguistic innovation.\n110The recently pop-\nular works of the late Ming and early Qing \u201charmed moral order \u201d; their in \ufb02uence\nwas why modern prose lacked the \u201cgreat workmanship \u201dof the \u201cGrand Secretar-\niat\u201d(\u7121\u9928\u95a3\u5927\u624b\u7b46), a reference to the literary style of the early Ming grand sec-\nretaries.111Associated with political encomium, this style suited the king \u2019s needs\nas he patronized writers in his version of the Secretariat, the Kyujanggak Acad-\nemy (\u594e\u7ae0\u95a3), to write in the service of good government and political ideals.112\nThrough them, Ch \u014fngjo ordered a comprehensive reprinting of Zhu Xi \u2019s writings\nand commissioned Embroidered Words of the Garden of Letters (Munw \u014fn pobulStory of the Eastern Chamber 47\n\u6587\u82d1\u9efc\u9efb), a collection of memorials, edicts, and policy proposals penned by fa-\nmous of \ufb01cials of the past to serve as models for the present.113Ch\u014fngjo also encour-\naged writing about model of \ufb01cials, such as Ch \u2019ae Chegong \u2019s\u8521\u6fdf\u606d(1720 \u201399)\n\u201cTale of the Loyal General Pak Y \u014fngs\u014f\u201d(Ch\u2019ungjanggong Pak Y \u014fngs\u014fch\u014fn\n\u5fe0\u58ef\u516c\u6734\u6c38\u7dd6\u50b3), which, as Youme Kim puts it, depicts a \u201cmorally healthy ruling\nclass. \u201dHe also propagated moral models for the population at large, when he com-\nmissioned works like Illustrated Guide to the Five Virtues (Oryun haengsil to \u4e94\u502b\n\u884c\u5be6\u5716), which celebrated the virtuous actions of commoners and aristocrats alike.114\nCrafting exemplars above for emulation below re \ufb02ected a top-down understanding\nof moral authority, with the Chos \u014fn court as its source.\nTongsanggi , despite its eulogy to royal authority, offers a rather different vision\nof moral and political authority.

Since Ch \u014fngjo and Yi Ok drew from\nthe same classical wellspring, the differences between their approaches are betterunderstood along different views of literature \u2019s moral function. Yi \u2019sw o r ko f t e n\nlampooned misbehaving elites, such as the philandering and cheating student\nSim, for falling short of declared moral standards.\n117In contrast to Ch \u014fngjo\u2019s\npreference for encomium, where prais e of authority erected positive models,\nYi Ok turned to satire.\nThe two modes of encomium and satire are complementary in the Mao com-\nmentary on The Book of Songs. This classical formulation describes literature \u2019s\nmoral function as follows: \u201cthose above use Airs [or: exert literary in \ufb02uence]\n(feng\u98a8) to transform those below; those below use the Airs [or: satirize] to cen-\nsure those above. \u201d118InThe Book of Songs, the folk songs of the Airs of the States\nful\ufb01lled the latter function. Their eulogies of virtue and verses of critique provided\nmoral lessons through their faithful re \ufb02ection of local conditions. Whereas Ch \u014fngjo\nsought to in \ufb02uence society from above, Yi Ok arrogated the power of moral suasion\nby censuring from below. When Yi Ok asks rhetorically, \u201cHow is it that we, who\nlive in the years of the Qianlong reign of the Great Qing and who dwell in the city ofHanyang in Chos \u014fn dare to stretch out our necks and open our thin eyes, and speak\nidly of the Airs of the States . . . the Music Bureau, and the lyrics and songs?, \u201dhe\nnot only implied that his own works were the current version of these classical\nforms.\n119By doing so, he also made a moral case for the representation of local\nspeci\ufb01city. Since the moral force of these lyrical genres drew from the directness\nof their emotional expression, the literary use of colloquialism and local languagewas desirable in the service of this authentic expression.\n12048 Sixiang Wang\nThese ideas were not necessarily antithetical to kingly authority, but they did\npose a challenge to the king \u2019s top-down visions of moral in \ufb02uence and literature \u2019s\nsocial function.

What needwould there be to maintain an unbroken line of succession to the classical past?\nWhat would be the purpose of a sovereign authority that rested on its ability to rep-\nresent universal ideals and models drawn from that past? What room was there forthe civilizing prerogatives of the sovereign and the moral models it sought to raise?\nTongsanggi, as a text, stands between the king and the exile to offer possible\nanswers, with the potential to reconcile them. Tongsanggi, by taking the \u201cold\u201dbach-\nelor Kim as the butt of light humor, highlighted the plight of fallen yangban who\nstruggled to maintain their status despite material deprivation.\n123Whatever social\ncritique this provided was ultimately resolved through kingly intervention. King-ship remained the lynchpin of moral order, ful \ufb01lling the fundamental charge of\n\u201ccorrecting mores \u201d(\n\u79fb\u98a8\u4fd7), as delineated in The Book of Songs . The text also de-\n\ufb02ected the potential charge that deviance from classical styles causes moral corrup-\ntion. Tongsanggi showed that colloquial language and vernacular culture could\nserve as a vehicle for moral edi \ufb01cation and the court \u2019s civilizing in \ufb02uence. Kingship\ncould maintain its position as civilizer, even within a vernacular literary space (butwith the caveat that this space be circumscribed by the sinograph). Linguistic devi-\nation from past models no longer threatened moral corruption; instead it offered a\nnew source of moral authority, actualized through the embrace of local speci \ufb01city.\n***\nTongsanggi, through anachronism, a con \ufb02ation of space, and the mixing of lin-\nguistic registers, blurred national, temporal, and stylistic boundaries.

It also made use of colloquial speech, mixing\ncontemporary spoken Chinese and Korean vernacular words, all the while placingKorean lyrical forms with archaic Chinese colloquialisms on the same page.

That is, how Chos \u014fn\nparticularity should be recognized against universal horizons \u2014for instance, how\ncontinuity could be maintained through cultural change and linguistic difference.\nTo the author of Tongsanggi , whether Yi Ok or a different individual, the text was\nless a challenge to royal authority than a proof-of-concept, a vision of literature\nand politics that could embrace Chos \u014fn Korea \u2019s local context and still accommo-\ndate the demands of royal authority. But when novel literary works like Tong-\nsanggi embraced local colloquialisms, they still unhinged linguistic signs from\nputatively stable meanings, shaking the foundations of textual authority, which\nnotions of Confucian universalism and the late Chos \u014fn vision of kingship de-\npended on for their articulation. For Ch \u014fngjo, who saw the stewardship of cultural\ncontinuity as the most urgent task of kingship, even the insinuation of relativism\ncounted as provocation.124\nIn Chos \u014fn Korea, debates over such questions are often overlooked because\nthey are expressed in a common Confucian discourse. But a common discourse\ndoes not translate into shared views. When confronted with the problem of changeand distance, Ch \u014fngjo hoped to reinforce the stability of the written word. Some of\nhis contemporaries, including the author of Tongsanggi , offered a different resolu-\ntion. They tried to embrace vernacular language, linguistic change, and Korea \u2019s\nlocal speci \ufb01city and argued for their essential compatibility with the broader pro-\ngram of Confucian civilization. Among them, Yi Ok even suggested that writing in\ncontemporary popular genres and local language can function as the new classicsof the day. Ch \u014fngjo, of course, balked at this notion. He once wrote, \u201c[There are\nthose] who compare Water Margin to Sima Qian \u2019sHistories and the Story of the\nWestern Chamber to the Mao commentaries to the Book of Songs . This is truly\nridiculous. If they really love [popular literature] only because it resembled the\n[classics], why don \u2019t they just read the Histories and Mao commentaries di-\nrectly? \u201d\n125For Ch \u014fngjo, the classics were not only timeless, but also irreplaceable.\nNOTES\nAn earlier version of this paper was presented at a panel organized by Kim Ho for the 2015\nAssociation of Korean Studies: Europe conference held in Bochum, Germany, and a laterversion at a panel organized by Matthew Fraleigh at the 2017 Modern Languages Associ-ation meeting in Philadelphia.

The Office was \noriginally conceived out of a bureaucratic strategy to formalize the training of its interpreters \nand manage the volatile knowledge they possessed. This bureaucratizing of diplomacy created \na distinct socio-economic niche for these interpreters, facilitating their social reproduction. \nThis article argues that a distinct culture of knowledge also emerged in this process. Beyond \nlanguage, interpreters also translated between multiple domains of knowledge. As experts of \ndiplomatic protocol, they served as informants to their social and administrative superiors. As \nscholars, they produced compendia and handbooks that made their office legible to outsiders. \nAs specialists, they asserted the dignity of their craft. And as diplomats, they were tasked \nwith furnishing the \u201capt response\u201d that enabled them to move between local exigency and the \ndemands of state ideology. Herein lies the central dilemma of bureaucratic knowledge: the skill \nto do so required both cultivated erudition as well as accumulated experience, but its timely \nexecution could not be legislated through bureaucratic rules\u2014a tension between the desire \nto control and the need to preserve agency. The article deliberately locates bureaucracy in a \ndomain (diplomacy), place (East Asia), and a time (premodern) that was not supposed to \u201chave\u201d \nbureaucracy in order to dispute the casual conflation of bureaucratization with modernization \nthat has obscured the Korean Office of Interpreters in the global history of diplomacy. \nThis article is part of a special issue entitled \u201cHistories of Bureaucratic Knowledge,\u201d edited by \nSebastian Felten and Christine von Oertzen.\nKeywords:  early modern diplomacy; go-betweens; interpretation; tributary system; translators\nOne of the longest continuously operational foreign service agencies in world history belonged to the \nChos\u014fn dynasty (1392\u20131910) of Korea. Its Office of Interpreters ( Say\u014fgw\u014fn) supplied the interpreters who \nmanaged the dynasty\u2019s diplomacy until its abolition in 1894.1 The expertise of these interpreters, like \nthe dragomans who mediated between European states and the Ottoman empire, extended far beyond \nlanguage. They mastered protocol, understood imperial culture, and navigated deftly between different \ndomains of knowledge.\nInterpreters were familiar \u201cgo-betweens\u201d in the contact zones along imperial frontiers, but the Korean \ninterpreters stand out in the early modern period as a product of a bureaucratic  strategy.2 Chos\u014fn recruited \nits interpreters from among its own subjects, training and evaluating them through an examination \nsystem.

The use of bureaucratic strategies in diplomacy by Chos \u014fn and its predecessor, Kory \u014f \n(918\u20131392), can be explained by a division of labor that corresponded to and reproduced social hierarchies \nat court. The leaders of Korean diplomatic missions, as well as the chief administrators of the interpretation \nOffice, were usually ad hoc  appointees drawn from the court aristocracy. It was they who represented the \nKorean ruler in formal rituals and corresponded with imperial officials. In contrast, the interpreters, hailing \nfrom a lower social echelon, usually managed the logistics of the missions, handled diplomatic documents, \nand translated for their superiors. Rather than the substance of diplomatic negotiation per se, the Office \ncontrolled the personnel charged with executing its procedures. \nInterpreters became targets of control because of their perceived unreliability. To their social and \nadministrative superiors, their ability in foreign tongues tendered intimacy with imperial politics that could \nupend established hierarchies within Korea. Limiting the agency of these \u201cgo-betweens\u201d through bureaucratic \nmechanisms was supposed to guard against this possibility as well as reduce the volatility of diplomacy \nin general. What resulted was a familiar bureaucratic dilemma. The Korean Court required reliability and \npredictability, but diplomatic exigency demanded local discretion and on-the-ground flexibility. Bureaucracy \nproscribed the interpreter to be a mere tool of mediation, but effectiveness depended on preserving his \nfreedom of action. \nThis dilemma placed a range of demands upon the interpreter, who traversed several domains of knowledge. \nIn addition to translating language, he bridged knowledge of his office with the broader workings of the \nstate apparatus, a process which involved making the Office of Interpreters legible to outsiders and asserting \nthe dignity of his specialized craft. The Korean interpreters, especially those who managed relations with \nimperial China, also served as informants and guides to their social and administrative superiors who \nrarely ventured beyond the country\u2019s borders. Once abroad, they also moved between local exigency and \nan imperial metanarrative that couched these diplomatic relations in terms of Korean fealty to a universal \nsovereign and a rhetoric of tribute.6 In many cases, it fell on the", "doc_id": "8ad54ed5-c7ac-4006-957c-f47d68bf2ab2", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "a9580da4adef7cee6ccd1963abd322e4d8997dec6e5f2d14a0c11fe22c3ee2af", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 3156, "end": 6740}, "relationships": {"1": "8dea7e62-9aa0-4ab2-997a-ced79f33bc1d", "2": "029ddfc6-6bbc-4413-99d2-0bfa671b8dc7", "3": "a0505169-f023-4193-bb0b-4b320fc615e7"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "a0505169-f023-4193-bb0b-4b320fc615e7": {"__data__": {"text": "placed a range of demands upon the interpreter, who traversed several domains of knowledge. \nIn addition to translating language, he bridged knowledge of his office with the broader workings of the \nstate apparatus, a process which involved making the Office of Interpreters legible to outsiders and asserting \nthe dignity of his specialized craft.

In this sense, diplomacy entailed a particular culture of knowledge. Akin to the \u201c epistemic \nculture\u201d of scientific or technical communities, the interpreter \u201c create[ed] and warrant[ed] knowledge\u201d \nparticular to the values and practices of his context.7 In this respect, the Office maintained the expertise \nnecessary for both diplomacy as such and its bureaucratic operation, covering both \u201cknow-what\u201d\u2014diplomatic \ninstitutions, discourses, and protocols\u2014and \u201cknow-how\u201d\u2014the procedural knowledge of how to operate the \n\u201cknow-what\u201d in response to specific contingencies.\nIn line with the methods modeled by Martin Mulsow and Lorraine Daston, the ensuing discussion \nadopts a longue dur\u00e9e  perspective on the Korean Office of Interpreters\u2019 \u201cknowledge culture.\u201d8 This vantage \nunderscores how the central dilemma of reliability that informed the bureaucratic solution continued to \nshape the Office\u2019s institutional development long after its establishment. The long view also allows a focus \non the stratum of diplomatic activity below the drama of state-to-state political negotiation: the quotidian, \nprocedural, and often obscured world of the Korean interpreter. Since the bulk of the diplomatic record \nfocuses on formal aspects of state-to-state interaction, to reach below this register means approaching it \nfrom an eclectic source base: a range of material produced by the hands of the interpreters themselves as \nwell as reading against the grain of anecdotal accounts in which interpreter activities only appear in the \nmargins.\n 4 Rothman, Brokering Empire , 167\u201371; Flores, \u201cL\u00edngua cosmopolite.\u201d\n 5 That is, by \u201csponsoring their education\u201d and \u201cgroom[ing] them for duties much more complex than one would assume of an expert \nlinguist.\u201d Zecevic, \u201cTranslating Ottoman Justice,\u201d 402\u20134.\n 6 Van Lieu, \u201cChos \u014fn-Qing Tributary Discourse,\u201d 80\u201387, 92\u2013100.\n 7 As first described in Cetina, Epistemic Cultures , 1\u20134.\n 8 Mulsow and Daston, \u201cHistory of Knowledge,\u201d 159\u201387; see also the introduction to this special issue, 5\u20136.\nWang: Chos\u014fn\u2019s Office of InterpretersArt. 9, page\u20093 of 15\nThe Office of Interpreters and the History of Diplomacy: \nA Historiographical Perspective\nTo see the Office of Interpreters as an example of bureaucracy deliberately locates bureaucracy in the \u201cwrong\u201d \nplaces: in diplomacy, in East Asia, and before the nineteenth century.

Although many of the \u201c questions and \ncontroversies\u201d surrounding bureaucracy were, in the words of Alexander Woodside, \u201c explored in [East Asia\u2019s] \nmandarinates a long time ago,\u201d a sense of inaptness persists because of outdated conceits surrounding \nbureaucracy\u2019s meaning in social theory. As discussed in the introduction to this special issue, these conceits \nowe in part to bureaucracy\u2019s peculiar relationship to European imperialism at the turn of the nineteenth \ncentury. But how they have been intertwined with the historiography of diplomacy means they require \nmore than a routine debunking before the story of the Korean Office of Interpreters as a bureaucracy  can \nbe recovered.9\nPrevailing narratives of diplomacy\u2019s history tend to sidestep the long-standing practice of formalized \ndiplomacy in Korea and East Asia. Primarily concerned with the emergence of the \u201cmodern\u201d international \nsystem, they thread its genealogy from the permanent legations of late medieval Italy through the Peace of \nWestphalia\u2014the fabled origin of treaty-based international law, territorial sovereignty, and the legal parity \nof sovereign states. Korea\u2019s diplomacy with imperial China, along with its distinct institutions, carried out \nthrough ad hoc envoy missions timed to a ritual calendar, stands apart from this Eurocentric narrative.10 \nTo be sure, the allure of the Westphalian myth has faded.11 With growing awareness of more diverse \nhistories, East Asian diplomacy \u201cbefore the West,\u201d no longer a mere curiosity or an epitome of Oriental \ninadequacy, has inspired alternative scholarly methodologies as well as anticipated imminent futures.12 But \ndid it ever make sense to mark these differences in diplomatic practice so sharply as East or West, modern \nor non-modern? In the heart of Europe, the Holy Roman Empire stood as a living, ironic counterpoint to \nthe supposedly Westphalian ideals of territorial sovereignty and sovereign equality.13 Having interacted for \ncenturies with the Ottomans, Europeans were also no strangers to a diplomatic regime dependent on ad hoc \nembassies and revolving around claims to universal sovereignty.14\nWhat once lent credence to these East-West binaries were the wholesale institutional changes in East \nAsian diplomacy in the late nineteenth century. In 1894, the Chos \u014fn dynasty abolished the centuries-old \nOffice of Interpreters in order to adapt to a nascent global system of international relations. With the arrival \nin East Asia of novel \u201cWestphalian\u201d institutions, older practices were understood, both in politics and in \nscholarship, as a dead end, with at most tangential relevance to how diplomacy is practiced today.15 When \nsuch stark lines are drawn between modern diplomacy and that of the \u201cpremodern\u201d ancien regime, the only \nsignificance reserved for the latter is as the obsolescent antecessor of the former. In this positivist temporality \nwhere history is organized in successive stages, the reorganization of diplomacy in late nineteenth century \nEast Asia works to make up for lost time by \u201c catching up\u201d to the West\u2014that is, by \u201cmodernizing.\u201d16\nThe notion of bureaucracy plays a critical, if implicit role, in reinforcing this positivist narrative.

One useful way forward is to consider instrumental rationality and value rationality as mutually \nconstitutive rather than as antithetical, ideal types fit for one stage of history or another. After all, as D. L. \nAvray has suggested, instrumental techniques proceed from, and later inform, the convictions held by the \nuser.19 From this frame of reference, what the lens of bureaucratic knowledge allows us to answer is not only \nwhat ends bureaucracy was designed to serve but also what values of knowing it engendered. \nTranslator as Traitor: The Principal-Agent Problem\nBureaucracy, not a timeless feature of statecraft, was a strategy deployed in response to specific circumstances. \nBefore the thirteenth century, the Kory \u014f dynasty already employed interpreters of spoken Chinese as well \nas the Khitan and Jurchen languages. Although occasionally recruited through exams, these interpreters \nwere not trained by the state.20 They were ready-made talent, such as political refugees of foreign origin \nor exceptional individuals, like one Kim T\u2019aes \u014f (?\u20131257), who were competent in both Chinese and the \nso-called \u201cbarbarian\u201d languages.21\nThe training of language experts by the Korean state only began with the establishment of the Translation \nBureau ( T\u2019ongmungwan ) in 1276. The new institute was designed to counteract the \u201charm brought to the \ncourt and dynasty\u201d by \u201ctongue-people who, hailing from obscure and lowly origins, transmit words without \nregard to their truth, often harboring evil designs to seek profit for their persons.\u201d22 It was, then, the classic \nprincipal-agent problem of traduttore, traditore , the \u201ctranslator as traitor,\u201d that bureaucratization promised \nto solve, a problem the Kory \u014f Court felt keenly in the decades prior to the cataclysms of the Mongol invasions.\nThe Mongols swept away much of the existing diplomatic order in northeast Asia. They sacked Zhongdu \n(now Beijing), the capital of the Jurchen Jin empire, in 1211, even killing a Korean envoy to the Jin in the \nprocess. After a long, bitter war of attrition, Kory \u014f eventually acquiesced to Mongol domination in 1259.23 \nIn the following period, the Kory \u014f Court came to rely on an interpreter named Cho Ingyu (1237\u20131308) \nwho hailed from an \u201c obscure\u201d background to enter the ranks of the court\u2019s official interpreters. His skill in \nMongolian even impressed the Mongol ruler, Khubilai Khan, who praised his linguistic skills. Cho\u2019s critical \nrole as mediator catapulted him to the highest rungs of Kory \u014f\u2019s government, a meteoric rise unprecedented \nin Kory\u014f\u2019s aristocratic society.24\nThe Kory\u014f royal family eventually sealed a marriage alliance with the Mongol imperial house.

The indispensable linguistic skills of the interpreter now enabled him to subvert the will \nof his erstwhile masters. The lowly social background of interpreters only compounded their ignominy, \nfor their political influence threatened the social privileges of Kory \u014f\u2019s traditional elite.25 Among speakers \nof \u201ctongues\u201d ( s\u014frin), to be celebrated like Cho Ingyu was rare, for they usually only appeared in the official \nhistories for having exceeded their station. Epithets such as \u201cpanderers\u201d or \u201cbetrayers\u201d highlighted how \nthey exploited their position as a mediator for personal advantage. One, for instance, curried favor with \nthe Mongol nobility by offering his knowledge of the Korean conditions for identifying opportunities for \nextracting new tribute from Kory \u014f.26 Another used his \u201cbeak\u201d to slander the Kory \u014f king at the Mongol court. \nIn retaliation, the Kory \u014f king wanted to torture the interpreter to death, but his cries for mercy in Mongolian \nconvinced the king to relent, sparing him because he was \u201cskilled at interpreting.\u201d27\n 18 For instance, the tension between birthright and meritocracy in Palais, \u201cConfucianism\u201d; Duncan, Origins , 59\u201398.\n 19 For a critical discussion of rationality in Weberian typologies, see D\u2019Avray, Rationalities , 117\u201337.\n 20 Ch\u014fng Inji et al., Kory\u014f sa, 21:13b; Pak, \u201cY \u014fmal S\u014fnch\u2019o t\u2019ongsa,\u201d 252\u201355.\n 21 Ch\u014fng Inji et al., Kory\u014f sa, 101:71a; Yi, \u201cKory \u014f sidae \u016di y\u014fkkwan,\u201d 220\u201331.\n 22 Ch\u014fng Inji et al., Kory\u014f sa, 106:12a\u201314a, 76:46b\u201347a. \n 23 Henthorn, Korea , 4\u20135, 14, 17\u201318; The Mongols also cultivated their own interpreters of Korean, see Henthorn, Korea , 21\u201322.\n 24 Ch\u014fng Inji et al., Kory\u014f sa, 105:36b\u201338a; Yi, Kaj\u014fng s\u014fnsaeng munjip , in HMC  3:118b\u201320b; Min, \u201cCho Ingyu (sang)\u201d; \u201cCho Ingyu \n(chung).\u201d\n 25 The traditional elite being the sajok  or yangban .

By 1368, Mongol rule had collapsed and been replaced by the Ming dynasty in China. Later, in \n1392, Kory \u014f was overthrown by Yi S \u014fnggye, who established the new Chos \u014fn dynasty in Korea. Having \ncome to power in a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat, Yi tried desperately to control the narrative of his rise. His own interpreters \nand diplomats, with lingering loyalty to Kory \u014f, subverted communication with Ming. They even implored \nthe Ming emperor to intercede and overthrow the new regime.28 As Yi struggled to find personnel that \ncould serve it effectively and loyally, in 1394 he recalled from exile a former Kory \u014f official, S \u014fl Changsu \n(1341\u20131399). A scion of an elite Uighur family who had served the Mongol empire for generations, he was \nentrusted with reforming the Translation Bureau, now renamed the Office of Interpreters.29 \nOnce appointed director, S \u014fl Changsu outlined his policies for training future interpreters in the new \nagency. There were to be three instructors, two in Chinese and one in Mongolian. An exam was to be held \nevery three years, open to cadets of the agency as well as any low-ranking government functionaries who had \nmastered the core Confucian classics and either the Chinese or Mongolian language (including its writing \nin the Uighur script). Depending on their performance, those who passed were given official ranks ranging \nfrom 7a down to 9a and their associated titles and salaries.30 S\u014fl also proposed levying boys under age fifteen \nfrom commoner families who displayed \u201cnatural gifts of intelligence\u201d as candidates for language training in \nthe Office. Those who later passed the recruitment examinations were rewarded with a salaried position, \nthough the cost of failure was high. Anyone who studied for three years but failed to understand Chinese or \nMongolian was impressed into the army.31 \nThe anxieties surrounding linguistic knowledge in S \u014fl Changsu\u2019s proposal departed from its Kory \u014f \npredecessors\u2014they were less about the reliability of knowledge than its precarity. What S \u014fl confronted was the \ndearth of suitable talent. In the multi-lingual, cosmopolitan Mongol empire, linguistic mediators generally \nplayed active roles even in local government administration, not just diplomacy.32 The intertwining of the \nKory\u014f-Mongol royal houses also spawned many overlapping institutional, political, social, and economic \nties, but Pax Mongolica\u2019s disintegration severed many of them.33 Ming proved reluctant to restore these ties, \neven rebuffing Korean entreaties to allow students to come to China to learn spoken Chinese. S \u014fl Changsu, \nas an \u00e9migr\u00e9, was one of the last in a fading generation of multilingual and transregional Korean elites.34 \nOver the next few centuries, the organization of the Office of Interpreters underwent certain incremental \nchanges.

An exam \nsystem governed recruitment and promotion. Recruits filled quotas, while performance in the regular exams \nthat occurred once every two or three years determined eligibility for certain roles. There were positions \nin the Office reserved for the scions of high officials, but once employed, they were not eligible for further \nadvancement or appointment to embassies without passing the exams.35 Salaries, ranks, and means of \nadvancement were governed by such regulations, while much of an interpreter\u2019s work surrounded the \nmanagement of paperwork and diplomatic routines. The outline of these rules was formally codified into the \nChos\u014fn dynasty\u2019s constitution, the Great Administrative Code  (Ky\u014fngguk taej \u014fn) in the late fifteenth century.36 \nCodification of Knowledge and the Dignity of the Bureaucrat\nIn an era of narrowed opportunity, Chos \u014fn interpreters attempted sporadically to recreate the political \nenvironment that once empowered their Kory \u014f predecessors. In 1407, an interpreter named Yi Hy \u014fn, a \nfourth-generation descendant of a Mongol \u00e9migr\u00e9 to Korea, was involved in a conspiracy with several high \nofficials to orchestrate a marriage between a Ming princess and the Korean heir apparent. They hoped to \nsecure a Ming imperial edict ordering the marriage so that it could be presented as a fait accompli to the \nhesitant Korean king. New dynastic ties could have reproduced the dynamics of Kory \u014f-Mongol relations, \nthereby assuring this cabal of outsized influence. The plan failed when the king discovered the plan.

As cross-border trade expanded, court interpreters were \ncounted among the kingdom\u2019s most wealthy denizens and influential cultural patrons by the nineteenth \ncentury.41 Despite their prominence, interpreters remained subordinate to their social and administrative \nsuperiors. Social exclusion worked alongside bureaucratic safeguards to temper the principal-agent problem \nand limit the potential for political influence. The directors ( tochejo ) overseeing the Office of Interpreters \nusually hailed from aristocratic lines and were passers of the vaunted literary state exams ( munkwa ). The rank \nand file claimed humbler pedigrees. As commoners or even scions of aristocratic families born to non-noble \nmothers, they were barred from the literary exams but could take the less prestigious interpretation exams, \na doorway to an alternate official career focused on diplomatic work, but one whose path of advancement \nwas limited.42 In rare instances, royal favor or exceptional service propelled a career interpreter into holding \nhigh office, but even bureaucratic rank did not translate into social acceptance among the aristocracy.43 As \na result, by the eighteenth century, professional interpreters, along with doctors, painters, geomancers, and \nother specialists in the Chos \u014fn government comprised an endogamous semi-elite social group.44 \nWith neither wealth nor official rank a substitute for social esteem, individual interpreters chafed against \nthis sense of discrimination, manifested in part by a denigration of their craft\u2014spoken language. The \nanecdote notebook kept by the interpreter \u014e Sukkw\u014fn (fl. 1530\u20131540) tells of a military officer who was \nmocked for his passion for learning spoken Chinese.

Though the East [i.e. Korea] is in one corner of the world, it none -\ntheless serves the Greater State [i.e. the Ming] above and it has relations with its neighbors below. \nWhether public or private, there are many matters that should be known by the highest official to \nthe lowest functionary, or even the gentleman living in leisure. And these matters can only be man -\naged without consternation if he consults references and investigates precedents.48 \nThe imagined audience for this text was a generic member of the court elite rather than other interpreters.49 \nRemedies for common ailments and animal bites, methods for removing splinters or ridding fleas and mites, \nand a laundry detergent recipe were certainly useful for a frequent traveler, whether a sojourner to Beijing \nor an official on the road.50 On the other hand, penal law, conversions of weights and measures, mourning \ngrades, statutes of limitations for slave and land disputes, a multiplication table, and a formula for making \nink had far wider relevance.51 Yet, for all its eclecticism, this versatile almanac devoted no space to the \ninterpreter\u2019s work with language. \u014e imagined his erudition to befit a scholar-statesman, authoritative for its \nuniversal relevance rather than the narrow quarry of a specialist.\n\u014e\u2019s approach to knowledge may be contrasted with that of another interpreter\u2019s compilation written over \na century later, the Compendium of the Translation Bureau  (T\u2019ongmun\u2019gwan chi ), whose title harkens back \nto the Kory \u014f-period name of the Office of Interpreters. If its extensive bibliography is any indication, it too \nwas a product of towering erudition.52 Its compilers, Kim Chinam (1654\u20131718) and his son Kim Ky \u014fngmun \n(1673\u20131737), consulted sixty-six different titles, \u201c collecting widely from what is written in the chronicles and \nstatutes of the dynasty, along with the writings and records of various scholars,\u201d including \u014e\u2019s encyclopedia. \nIn the preface, Kim Ky \u014fngmun explained they had undertaken this project because: \nI know humbly that interpreters are indispensable to the state. Although their person is insignifi -\ncant, their duties are important. In serving the Great State and communicating with neighbors, \nthese men have their way; when it comes to exercizing it, their tools are regulations, protocols, and \ntemplates.

Its \nvantage was not the top-down gaze of an administrator but followed a roughly chronological progression of \nthe entire process  of an embassy as it unfolded, beginning with the first meeting of the Office\u2019s officials and \nending with the embassy\u2019s departure from Beijing. It, however, lacked the systematicity of the Compendium  \nand offered little explanation or context for its entries, likely because its audience was presumed to be a \nfellow interpreter already in the know. Its mere fifty-five folios delved into far more detail than what could \nbe accommodated in the more voluminous Compendium \u2014for instance, the protocol for delivering candles \nand wine at way stations, or what to do with the fish and chickens received at the hostel in Beijing.57\nThe great detail of Yi Sangjok\u2019s notebook suggests that even a thorough official compilation such as the \nCompendium  could only cover a fraction of diplomacy\u2019s procedures and protocols, providing a holistic, \nrather than a comprehensive overview. The greatest beneficiaries were likely the high officials appointed \nto oversee the bureau. Like Chos \u014fn\u2019s ambassadors, these administrators were aristocrats drawn from the \ncivil officialdom and appointed for terms as short as only several months, not career interpreters. With the \nCompendium  as a reference, such an administrator could draw upon a common body of explicit knowledge \nrather than the tacit institutional memory of the very individuals he was charged with overseeing. The \nCompendium  was therefore also a medium of translation that made the bureaucrat\u2019s knowledge legible to \nan external audience. \nIt is hard to say to what degree codification transformed everyday practice at the Office. What is certain \nis that the Compendium , even with its regular reprintings and updates, could not satisfy the court\u2019s desire \nfor legibility. Chos \u014fn state agencies maintained administrative ledgers of their activities with the diplomatic \nrecord scattered across them. The late eighteenth century saw an effort to consolidate these records into a \nmonumental compilation, the Assembled Reference of Unified Writing  (Tongmun hwigo ). Mobilizing a team of \ninterpreters, this project organized past diplomatic cases according to arenas of policy, thereby satisfying a \ndifferent administrative desire: to create legibility by compartmentalizing policy into discrete, self-contained \nchains of precedents and models.58 In a sense, bureaucracy has a tendency to spawn more bureaucracy\u2014the \nimpulse to organize, compile, and codify ostensibly makes administration more manageable, but producing \nand organizing knowledge often requires another layer of administration.\nWhat, then, did this production of knowledge achieve? If, as in Weber, bureaucracy routinized charisma \nto produce legitimate authority, we may ask instead: what of the knowledge this routinization produced? \nA way out is to turn Weber on his head. The routines of Chos \u014fn\u2019s Office of Interpreters were themselves \nemployed in the service of producing a sense of routine that possessed its own charismatic authority.

Korean diplomats could \nappeal to such precedents to argue against unfavorable imperial policy. But, as will be discussed in the next \nsection, this codification comes with a certain irony, for the work of the interpreter often resisted this kind \nof containment. And it is in light of this dilemma that the interpreter\u2019s social rank plays an unexpected role.\nThe Place of the Apt Response\nThe importance of social ascription in shaping the interpreter\u2019s professional identity appears antithetical to \nthe meritocratic rationales of bureaucracy. Indeed, interpreters often protested their discrimination through \nappeals to meritocracy.59 Unfavorable pedigrees limited an interpreter\u2019s prospects, but it also enabled a few \npatrilines, for instance that of Kim Chinam, to dominate the profession. By the late nineteenth century, a \nmere nine patrilines produced around one-fifth of all seven thousand or so known passers of the specialist \n 56 Ch\u2019oe Hang et al., Ky\u014fngguk taej \u014fn 3:17b\u201318b; Kim, T\u2019ongmun\u2019gwan chi , 1:9b\u201310a; Yi, \u201cChos \u014fn hugi chapkwa kyoyuk,\u201d 37\u201342.\n 57 Yi, Y\u014fnhaeng sarye , 39a, 40a.

A few families possessed an \nobvious advantage that compounded over time, but they never truly monopolized these privileges.60 \nSocial ascription and bureaucracy have a more ambivalent relationship than might at first be apparent. \nSocial reproduction contributed to the long-term maintenance of the tacit knowledge the bureaucracy \ndesired.61 The interpreter\u2019s social debasement vis-\u00e0-vis the aristocracy paralleled a division of labor and \nknowledge.

As the embassy approached the Ming border, the chief \ninterpreter was blamed for misplacing a diplomatic document for delivery to the Ming Ministry of Rites; \nthough it was soon found, the chief envoy had him flogged with a heavy staff as punishment.62 The interpreter \nin question, named Song Taech\u2019un, a son of a minor official, had passed first in his class of candidates in the \n1564 interpretation exams, but even this stellar achievement could not spare him personal humiliation.63 \nIndeed, in moments of duress, the interpreter served as a ready scapegoat for larger diplomatic failures.64 \nOn the other hand, under the interpreter\u2019s purview were virtually all the procedures of diplomacy. The \nrituals that punctuated each envoy mission could only take place if someone properly handled the quotidian \nmatters of logistics, provisions, lodging, and pathfinding that were beneath the dignity and beyond the ken \nof an aristocrat-envoy. It was the interpreter who provided him the answers about recent developments in \nMing politics and maintained institutional memories of past embassies.65 After all, while the journey to \nBeijing was a once-in-a-lifetime affair for the envoy, the professional interpreter, figuratively, \u201cspends his \nmornings in Seoul and the evenings in Beijing, until he ends his in old age in travel.\u201d66 As the ears and mouth \nof his mute and deaf superiors, he assumed the burden of informal diplomacy\u2014with the right cajoling (or \nbribe), an imperial official might turn a blind eye to transgressions. It was here, in the informal realm, that \nlower social status became an asset.\nThe 1574 embassy had begun inauspiciously for interpreter Song, but he proved indispensable once the \nembassy reached Ming Liaodong, where it encountered a recalcitrant Ming official named Chen Yan. The \nembassy, delayed by heavy rains in Korea, hoped Chen would speed them along to Beijing. Song brought the \nembassy\u2019s gifts to Chen, but the offering disappointed him. Chen, irate, had requested of the last passing \nKorean embassy a number of items, of which five copies of an envoy poetry anthology, sixty sheets of smooth \npaper, and three silk hats had yet to be delivered. Song tried to calm Chen by explaining the anthology was \nout of print, the paper was reserved only for diplomatic documents, and the silk hats would be delivered \nby the next embassy, which would pass in advance of the winter solstice. Chen, scoffing at the interpreter\u2019s \n\u201c clever words,\u201d offered two rolls of hat-silk, one roll of silk gauze, and twenty rolls of damask to the Koreans in \nexchange for otter skins, patterned mats, cotton bolts, patterned ink slabs, multi-colored cloth, and ginseng. \nTo Chen\u2019s chagrin, Song declined the offer.

While Song negotiated \nthe terms of graft, the diarist noticed a bulletin in the government office which stated: \u201cChos \u014fn is a country \nthat has long observed ritual and righteousness\u2026 . [O]fficials at way stations who impose arbitrary exactions, \ndeceive, extort, or force commerce have failed in observing China\u2019s [duty] to cherish men from afar \u2026 and \nshall be apprehended and interrogated without mercy.\u201d The bulletin placed Chen Yan in charge of enforcing \nthe very prohibitions he was guilty of flouting. For the diarist H \u014f Pong, an occasional traveler to China, these \ntwo realities could not be more incoherent, but the interpreter\u2019s task was to translate from the quotidian \ndomain of petty profiteering and tit-for-tat exchanges to the highfalutin idiom of benevolent empire. It was \nprecisely at the interstices of these domains that an interpreter like Song Taech\u2019un thrived.70\nWorking at these interstices demanded discretion and flexibility, but the diplomatic strategy of the \nChos\u014fn state relied on consistency. Refrains presenting Chos \u014fn Korea as an ever-loyal vassal, a civilized \ncountry beholden to Confucian norms, and ruled by a wise king were key to binding Ming, and later Qing, \nto reciprocal political commitments.71 The bureaucratic impulse to formalize this representation through \ndocumentary templates, lists of tributary gifts, sample diplomatic letters, records of diplomatic protocols, \nand chronicles of past relations in institutional handbooks all favored consistency and regularity over \nindividual discretion. But if formalization by definition limits discretion, where does that leave the on-the-\nground flexibility displayed by Song Taech\u2019un that was so necessary to diplomatic activity?\nAn interesting attempt to integrate a sense of flexibility with formal knowledge is the sixteenth-century \nPhrasebook of the Interpreter\u2019s Bureau  (Sangw\u014fn che\u014f). The passages it collected were at once linguistic \nsamples of colloquial Chinese and expositions of what an interpreter ought to know. The passages in \ncolloquial Chinese described the organization of the Ming bureaucracy, the titles and functions of officials, \nas well as the protocols, ceremonies, and banquets expected in Beijing. It also included canned responses to \npotential questions from interlocutors, which consisted of stock professions of the Korean king\u2019s loyalty to \nMing and descriptions of the high level of civilization in Chos \u014fn. Most remarkable was a formulaic protest \nagainst an inconvenient Ming policy, the curfew preventing Korean envoys from traveling freely in Beijing:\nI just want to report one matter.

This translation relied on a tacit, procedural knowledge of \u201cknow-how,\u201d which unlike the \u201cknow-\nwhat\u201d of imperial institutions and diplomatic protocols, resisted formalization. Interpreter\u2019s manuals could \nlist standard rates for customary \u201cgifts\u201d to cultivate good \u201cpersonal feeling\u201d ( inj\u014fng), but they could not \nimpart the savvy of reacting to circumstance, one embodied by the person of the interpreter.\nSuch \u201cknow-how\u201d resisted codification through regulation but could nevertheless be inferred from \nnarratives in historical records.

Such was P\u2019yo H \u014fn\u2019s \nability to adapt flexibly to circumstances.74 \nIn this anecdote, drawn from the biographies ( inmul ) section of the Compendium of the Translation Bureau , \nthe interpreter, by dint of his quick-thinking, moved seamlessly between two coexisting realities. One was \nthe shared diplomatic reality between the Chinese envoy and the Korean Court, where the king punished \nthe interpreter for his clumsiness that harmed the dignity of the Korean Court and offended the Chinese \nenvoy. The other was the local reality, where the interpreter\u2019s quick thinking saved the king from personal \nembarrassment, a praiseworthy act earning him his promotion. The exemplary interpreters honored in the \nCompendium modeled virtuous, loyal, and self-sacrificing conduct but also demonstrated their ability to \neffect an \u201c apt response\u201d capable of negotiating the competing demands of a tricky diplomatic encounter. \nRecognizing the value of repeated experience with diplomatic exigencies was likely why, according to one \n1589 statute, one \u201cyoung and intelligent\u201d student of the academy was selected to accompany every envoy \nmission to Beijing. The reason offered was improving language ability, but it also pointed to the value of \nexperience for the cultivation of the interpreter\u2019s craft.75 The value of \u201cknow-how\u201d also puts into perspective \nthe compilers\u2019 regret that though \u201c envoy missions came and went without cease for thousands of years,\u201d \nthe name and deeds of those who staffed them \u201chave been buried in obscurity.\u201d What the compilers of the \nCompendium  desired was the preservation of an institution\u2019s memory, as well as its ethos.76\nConclusion\nIn the case of the Korean Office of Interpreters, bureaucracy emerged as a solution to classic principal-agent \nproblems of control, reliability, predictability. These problems were arguably inherent to the position of \nthe interpreter; not only did he possess a dangerous knowledge of foreign tongues, he also occupied the \ninterstitial zones of diplomacy, spaces where individual agency needed to be preserved for his effective \ndeployment. Bureaucratic formalization therefore needed to constrain just as much as it needed to enable. \nThis intersection of diplomacy and bureaucracy, with its specialized demands of linguistic, textual, and \nprocedural knowledge, enabled interpreters to construct a socio-economic niche for themselves and their \ndescendants.77\nWhat, then, is the significance of the Office of Interpreters for the broader discussion of bureaucratic \nknowledge?
